Love this under-all cami tank ?,"Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft, smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!",5,07/06/2018
Staple tank!,Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!,5,01/09/2018
Love but also very annoying,"I love this tank, it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws. it rolls up every time i walk or do anything, it becomes very bothersome.",2,30/06/2018
"Gorgeous top, straps way too long","I just adore this top! it is so comfy and stylish. i wear it with a little purple cardigan and feel like an iris in bloom. like other reviewers have mentioned though, the straps are way too long. i had to cut them down and re-sew to make it wearable. before that it just slouched in front and looked sloppy and awful. i tried layering under it, which looked absurd.",4,18/07/2018
Great layering piece,"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",5,11/07/2018
Oldie but goodie,"I'm currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dress/tunic. i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me (5'3"" 36dd) without enhancing what i want to hide. great for winter",5,04/08/2018
Four winters in... a winner!,"I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too.",5,30/11/2018
Great coverage,"This bathing suit has everything. i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom. finally the coverage my booty needs. i've worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.
the only drawback is it doesn't dry very quickly. after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when i'm laying out in the summer heat.",5,11/04/2018
Cute suit-didn't work for me,"This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.",1,07/02/2018
Retro style,I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.,5,28/08/2018
Alas not as good as it looks,"The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.",2,05/04/2018
Love this suit!,"I am 5'5, 150lb, generally size medium shirt, size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas, which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good, it hid my problem spots, showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet, however, it makes me feel great, and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!",5,05/03/2018
Not what i expected,"I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.",2,18/05/2018
Such a nice bathing suit!,"This is my first one piece bathing suit, and i absolutely love it. the quality is great ! the color doesn't fade.
i usually wear a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly.",5,18/03/2018
Okay leggings,"The velvet isn't as soft or plush as i thought it would be but these are comfy pants. i won't wear them until next winter, which is fine.",4,05/10/2018
Comfy and cute,"This dress is comfortable and a great piece to travel with. goes with ballet flats, sandals, to ankle boots.",4,11/06/2018
Wanted to love it,"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.

finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",2,29/05/2018
Beautiful staple item,"Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo, even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux, i took an xs, whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo, although much looser on me.",5,27/11/2018
Stylish but strange,"I love the color, the fabric and the style (especially in the model shots) but in reality, the cut is disproportionate. the hips and hip pockets flare out creating a saddlebag look. it is not smooth and fitted as shown on the model. overall you need to size down since i could pullover the dress without unzipping. i think the felted boiled wool is great quality but a tiny bit itchy. i still recommend the dress because i will be wearing it with a long sweater coat which will hide the weird hip act",4,07/09/2018
Luxurious and flattering,The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.,5,21/07/2018
Incorrect sizing,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,2,29/09/2018
Gorgeous,"This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light, airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.",5,20/09/2018
Love this dress!,"I absolutely love this dress! i got it right after my first baby was born to wear to an outdoor, early october wedding. it was perfect! the fit is flattering and the dress is well made. it's a classy, elegant dress and i have worn it many times since.",5,21/02/2018
Disappointing quality,"I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.",1,17/10/2018
Should've gotten a larger size,"I purchased this jacket in my usual size s, but wish i would've chosen the m. the small works, but the sweater sleeves are tighter than i would've liked, making it hard to layer other clothes underneath. the sleeves are also just a little too short.",4,29/04/2018
Classy black dress,"My husband bought this for my birthday. i love that it can be dressed up or worn for a more fun occasion.

i'm a tad small up top, so it fits a little too loose up there, but other than that it fits great. i'm considering getting it altered just because i love it so much.",4,20/11/2018
Love love love,Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!,5,14/10/2018
Please bring this shirt back!!!,"This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please, please bring it back!!",5,28/10/2018
"Fun and gorgeous suit, but not for me","This was the first suit i've ever ordered online and the first one piece i've tried since i was a very young girl, so i was a little skeptical going into this. i'm 5'9"", ~145 lbs, 34b, with a pear shape and short torso. i was pleasantly surprised by the overall fit--the length was right, the bottoms fit really well (i was nervous about the boy short/hip hugger design), and the suit was just very comfortable and cute. however, something about the cups just didn't work with my chest; my breasts di",4,07/06/2018
Worth it!,This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother's one-piece.,5,08/03/2018
Love this swimsuit!,"This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.

i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said, i went with a",5,31/05/2018
Super unflattering,"I'm 5' 5"", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast.",2,16/03/2018
Great for bigger busts,"I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews",5,28/08/2018
Great coverage,"I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height , weight, and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu",5,20/11/2018
Adorable and cozy,"This sweater is the best sweater to throw on over a buttoned blouse, t-shirts, long sleeves, tanks. i always get comments on how comfortable and adorable this sweater is. a worthwhile buy.",5,19/10/2018
Cute holiday dress,"I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it, found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.",4,15/09/2018
So glad this comes in 32 d!,This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.,5,04/11/2018
Please make in more florals and patterns!,"This suit is perfect in every way! (the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size) i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit bigger.

please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!",5,11/06/2018
Perfect fit an flare,"I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier, i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.",5,27/03/2018
Runs large,"I love this dress, but have found that this brand runs large. i'd order a size down.",4,17/08/2018
"Pretty, but not the most comfortable","I got the burgundy color and i do have to say that the color looks a little better online than it does in person, but it's not too much of a difference. this is a really cute thong, and if you're just trying to be sexy/romantic, then i think it would be fine and there's nothing at all wrong with it. however, i like to wear thongs just in general because i think they're comfortable and i like not having to worry about panty lines, and this is definitely not the most comfortable. the front pattern",4,14/06/2018
The best boy short,"I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.",5,16/10/2018
Breathtaking,"I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!",5,26/01/2018
So comfortable!,Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!,5,04/06/2018
Beautiful,Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.,5,29/11/2018
Gorgeous!,"This fit perfectly. i am 5'7 , 138 pounds and ordered a small. i was very pleased with the way it draped over my body. i bought the black one.",5,07/05/2018
More compliments than i could have imagined,"I knew when i bought this bralette that there was something special about it...the intricacy of the design is really pretty as is the style...but seriously - every single time i wear this bralette out (paired with a cute top or dress) i get tons of compliments from all of my friends. i never thought a bralette would spark so much conversation! aside from that it is super durable...i've had it for a year now, have washed it several times, and it is not stretched out at all or frayed aka it is gre",5,27/08/2018
Perfect fit,I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.,5,13/05/2018
Sexy and classic,This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,5,12/03/2018
Lovely!,"Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.",5,18/03/2018
Natori t back,"It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however, i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight, perhaps that might help with the fit?",3,15/02/2018
Pretty and feminine,"I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.",5,18/11/2018
Functional beauty,"I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing, i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather",5,20/11/2018
Everyday tights,These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.,5,24/02/2018
Lovely,"Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!",5,15/08/2018
Love this!,I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase,5,08/10/2018
Pretty,"Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary.",5,23/01/2018
Classic and comfortable,Great bra. fits well. works under tighter t-shirts. just be aware that the straps do clearly read calvin klein. more mauve than pink.,5,13/03/2018
"Cute pants, but short.","These pants have a really cute design. however, they are a bit short (and i'm only 5'4""). i'm still happy i purchased them, but i thought i was purchasing full length pants (as shown on the model) and not capris.",4,10/10/2018
It's a no,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"", 114#, 34b",2,12/06/2018
Truly a fine gown for the feminine!,A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.,5,11/09/2018
Love,"I love this gown so much, i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy, beautiful, and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite, hands down.",5,08/12/2018
Beautiful suit!,"I purchased the teal suit and it was so beautiful! it's super comfortable and has nice coverage. i decided to return it because, as a nursing mom i've decided to wait until i've weaned the baby so i can make sure the fit is still good. but otherwise i would have kept it!",4,05/02/2018
Gorgeous and flattering,"I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it, my mom surprised me with a gift card, so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering, and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!",5,30/01/2018
Love this piece!!!,"This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.",5,02/11/2018
Love the cut and lace strip on the back.,"I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath (because of the lace detailing on the back). however, this shirt is a bit see-through, so i still had to wear a tank with it. it's very cute even with the tank though!",5,23/08/2018
Cant go wrong,"I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.",5,03/05/2018
Super comfy and cute,"These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since it's not ""hemmed"" to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!",5,13/11/2018
Beatiful and great quality for the price,"I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such",5,25/03/2018
Beautiful and comfortable,"I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully, natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )",5,17/04/2018
Thank goodness!,"I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute, comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm, are incredibly soft, and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!",5,05/10/2018
Fabulous,"These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.",5,22/09/2018
Love the pattern,I bought this as a present and am very happy with it! the pattern is fun and i like the slouchy fit.,4,07/04/2018
Great quality tank,"I love these tanks. the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps. they're soft. and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short. because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like, the straps are a little long, but after i alter them with a little sewing, they're perfect. i've had to do this with retailer tanks in the past, and it's worth it to me for the quality that i'm getting. the regular price is too high, so i only buy them on sale. i try",5,30/10/2018
So cute,I love this!!!! nice and lightweight. super stylish,3,25/05/2018
Extra fabric,"There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine, but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back, especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped, but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.",3,29/04/2018
Casual short,Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.,5,07/02/2018
So pretty,This robe is such a pretty design. very flowy- runs slightly large in my opinion but was so cute i decided to keep it!,4,27/06/2018
Love this dress,Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.,5,20/08/2018
Exactly what i was missing from my wardrobe,I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,5,27/10/2018
Go to going out tank,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,5,24/08/2018
Best shorts...ever!,These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.,5,22/03/2018
Calvin klein quality,"Love love love this pair of underwear (yes, i'm writing this about underwear). they're comfortable, flattering, and no vpl (visible panty line) without having to wear a thong.",5,21/05/2018
Exactly as pictured,"Love this bra! i was looking for something feminine and sexy and this is perfect. it's exactly as pictured. i was worried the material would be too delicate and fragile, but it's really durable! my only issue is that it fits a tiny bit awkwardly because of the solid material on the side, but it doesn't actually look awkward, just feels a bit odd at first. i highly recommend it if you're looking for something sweet and sexy!",4,28/01/2018
So fun!,"I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it, but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well, but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist, but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas",5,20/06/2018
Cute and fun,Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!,5,13/11/2018
Beautiful...runs very small,This bra is beautiful. the lace is so lovely and soft and looks fabulous on. my only criticism is it runs very small. i am a 32 a and order the size 1 and it is snug... just order a size up (or two) and it should be perfect.,4,05/06/2018
Perfectly flattering,"I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size 32c and it fits perfectly. my current measurements are 33-25-37 or 38 hips, and i normally wear a 30d or 32c bra.
.
i have a longish torso, yet this doesn't ride up. fits like on the model. there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down. the v-shape is held by a hard wire, but it doesn't cut in anywhere. the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap",5,14/03/2018
Size and function,Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.,2,16/06/2018
My favorite socks,I am so happy i decided to purchase these. they are the only invisible socks i've found that actually stay on my feet. all others always slip off my heel... these are great!,5,02/11/2018
Design too fluorescent,"I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that, it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo, it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an",3,24/05/2018
Glorious,Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!,5,07/08/2018
Love this!,"I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.",5,08/04/2018
Trust this brand- hanky pinky,"I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie, but the quality, fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this, but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand, it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut, the fabric is clearly lace, but beautifully done. and the feel is lov",5,20/03/2018
Size up,"It's beautiful, but more sheer on bottom than it appears in photo. size up.",4,03/08/2018
Cute bedtime boyshort,"I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans, but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.",4,08/10/2018
Some things you should know...,"First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn't expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it's a nice oversized fit for my 5'3"" 125 pounds. i wouldn't want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don't mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot",4,23/08/2018
The perfect leggings,"I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality, thick enough to feel appropriately covered, and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!",5,08/06/2018
Better than leggings!,"I'd describe these as a hybrid pant/legging. they are very comfortable flattering, and versatile. i got the large because medium was sold out, but they fit nice, not super tight.",5,19/06/2018
Great leggings!,"Wonderful fit - love that these have a bit of texture to them and the structure is perfect. easy to wear with ankle boots or flats, and thick enough that you don't have to worry about see-through incidents. the only issue that i have is that the elastic in the waistband isn't secured, so it tends to twist around - just a minor annoyance and wouldnt stop me from ordering these in another color!",4,28/09/2018
Good basic,"Great pair of black pants, a step up from basic leggings. nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides. would recommend.",5,13/02/2018
Stylish,"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging.",5,13/10/2018
Love them,"They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.",5,02/02/2018
Too much like jodphurs!,Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.,2,30/01/2018
Best leggings ever,"After reading the reviews, these leggings seemed to be the best leggings ever. i'm usually not a leggings gal, but decided these might be the ones to take me through winter with long cozy sweaters. i read the profile of those who purchased and were happy with the fit before making my purchase. i'm 5'2"", 134lbs and bought a medium. while they fit nicely through the waist and thighs, from the knees down they're baggy and really don't fit like a legging. in the photo you can see some slack around t",4,04/09/2018
Stretched out upon receipt,"I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet",1,19/07/2018
Feel like leggings - look like pants!,Soooooo cute. fit like a dream. look like regular pants. could dress up or dress down. i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable. going to buy in the black as well. normally wear size 4-6 got the small and fits perfect.,5,09/06/2018
So disappointing!,"I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater",1,06/02/2018
Too small in the chest for a size large,"I ordered a size large, however as a large, my chest is large as well. this nighty barley covered me (in the chest region). the rest of the body fit well.",2,20/07/2018
Pretty!,"I love wearing this to bed and it's really pretty! the lace is thin and delicate, so it can get snagged easily, but it's pretty comfortable. the only thing that could make it more comfortable is if the material underneath the bust was looser, though it wouldn't be as supportive. overall, i think it's a very beautiful chemise!",4,26/08/2018
"Great idea, poor execution","I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately, this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly, the fit is slim, not relaxed. i'm 5'4"", at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally, the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece, however this w",3,31/03/2018
Pretty but runs way too small,"I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color, it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.",3,03/09/2018
Great for summer,I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.,5,08/12/2018
Sizing is off,"The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(",2,21/07/2018
Sizing is off,"Good design, comfortable fit. however, sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper.",4,19/04/2018
So cute!,"It is an expensive panty, but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!",5,21/04/2018
Shimmer in silver/grey - size down,"As in most ribbed camis, this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.",4,02/08/2018
"Very thin fabric, not worth $90","The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.",2,19/07/2018
Perfect stylish comfort,"First off, these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.",5,07/04/2018
Not great quality :(,"I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :(",2,31/01/2018
Gorgeous,"It's a phenomenal wardrobe peice. quality, comfort, versatile. dress it up or down, belt it or not, boots or shoes. i'm 5'3"", 115ish lbs, small fit my 34d chest beautifully. a great buy - have fun with it!",4,09/06/2018
Flexible use,"I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer, the length was not awkward and kept it from being to",5,31/05/2018
Great dress!!,"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy, which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves, lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear, looked styl",5,10/09/2018
Blue/grey color is fantastic,"The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11"" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!",5,24/07/2018
Gorgeous,"Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.",5,30/03/2018
Not sleepwear!,"I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.",5,10/08/2018
Great everything vest,I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!,5,28/03/2018
Love this!,I bought it in black and cream! great weight. soft fabric. beautiful lace.,5,30/06/2018
I didn't realize this (used to) come in black...,"Looks really nice on teh pictures. i tried on thre cream as this was the only color availalbe at my store (tried on per stylist recommendation(. it is very thin, you can see ripples from my belly lol, but still fairly flattering. i ended up purchasing, but it is in my maybe pile for now... wil lwait before wearing it to be sure. can't wear a grey bar with it, that htin...",4,21/02/2018
Nice design,I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.,5,14/04/2018
So pretty!,This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.),5,15/03/2018
"Cute, with reservations","First one i received was ripping apart already in the sleeve opening at wrist (warning: very tight sleeves!), plus 2"" of the green shiny band detail was missed altogether by whomever sewed this particular one- just left unstitched. and long threads were hanging in several places. this is by no means a quality piece and is severely overpriced. on the positive side, it is very cute and i'm keeping the replacement one, but know that it is also delicate. after one use, there is a snag on the inside",3,02/02/2018
Excellent fit and quality,"As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep",5,21/04/2018
Love it!,Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.,5,29/08/2018
"Easy, comfortable and beachy chic","This dress is very comfortable and casual, but in a high quality fabric that makes it great for a summer dinner with dressy sandals. i don't think a bra can be worn with it which i don't mind at all but might be a problem for others.",4,25/01/2018
Very soft but lighter weight than it looks,"Soft, cozy, and the heathered off-white/palest gray is a great cool-toned neutral. the only surprise was that it is lightweight; not nearly as warm as it looks. the hood has a fuzzy sherpa lining, the unlined jacket has a soft fleece or flannel finish on the inside with zigzag seams, the ouside looks like a sweatshirt. it does work great as a top layer though. 50% polyester, 38% cotton, 12% rayon.

got this in a size 's' to fit my hips and it works out great. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37ish, wi",4,22/07/2018
A big ruggy,"The material is super soft and i could see how this could be a great fall sweater, but the furry portion made the top too bulky. i should've sized down, but even then i think it still would've been a touch boxy. if it was boxy all the way through it'd be fine, but it feels like just the top was bulky while the bottom half was fine. perhaps good for more broad shouldered people. i have very small shoulders. also reminded me too much of a sheepskin rug.",3,03/04/2018
On the fence,"I *loved* the brown color on the model, and i love the wrap style in general. however, i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7"", 137 lbs 32 b), which fit, but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin, but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me, so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s",3,05/03/2018
Not worth the money,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,2,26/03/2018
Comfortable and cozy,"I like this robe a lot. the tassel detailing on the ties is beautiful. i like the soft interior-but wish it went all the way down the arms. the cozy part of the robe is only in the center section and hood-the arms can be a bit chilly while the rest of you is warm and cozy.

i do not think the robe is necessarily flattering, in that it does not do me favors in the way of slimming, it is more of a cozy-around-the-house robe rather than one to hide lingerie underneath.",4,20/10/2018
Doesn't wash well,"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.",1,25/10/2018
Beautiful,I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.,5,20/09/2018
Fabulous,"Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the
quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs",5,11/05/2018
Mixed feelings,"I ordered these in a size small on sale, thinking that because of the material, they might not fit. they are actually very cute, and fit in the waist/legs, but in the crotch area, as another reviewer mentioned, they could fit a little better. they look fine with a longer top so i decided to keep them.",4,05/10/2018
Cute top,Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!,1,19/02/2018
Great product for a great price!!,"Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!",5,24/06/2018
Love!,"Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i'm 5'11"", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom.",5,24/08/2018
Need more than 1!,"I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!",5,29/08/2018
Had to return,"This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear, though.",2,10/08/2018
Comfy and adorable tank top!,This tank is super soft and very well fitted. it fits true to size. the lace is so pretty in front but what makes this unique is the lace on the back of the top. it is a unique design and good quality!,5,20/09/2018
Deep 'v',"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi, jacket, sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1"", 115lbs, i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t",4,28/06/2018
"Lovely top, but too tight",The top is a pretty design. it's a low v-neck. but it would be nice for layering. it was just way to tight. runs small. order up a size.,4,25/01/2018
Lace layering tank,"This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also, it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty, and if you purchase it for that, then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.",3,09/11/2018
So cozy,"Love wearing these, i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter",5,14/11/2018
"Casual, pretty and simple",I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.,5,20/07/2018
These pants make me want to smile,"Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands, have worn them when flying, etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well, no ironing needed.",5,14/07/2018
Chirpy sleepy,These are darling. love flannel and pattern which is very upbeat. wish they were a little more pegged/slim/tapered at the bottoms.,4,15/02/2018
Lounge like royalty!,"I ordered these in a xxs, a little nervous about them being too small, and i was very pleased with the fit. for reference, i'm 5'2, 98lbs. these are great for all seasons, the lining is warm, yet adds a pop of color when cuffed. the crowns on the birds are pretty nifty!",5,30/08/2018
Can go either petite or not,"I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality.",5,05/10/2018
Love these chirpy loungers!,"When i saw these lounge pants, i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!",5,20/06/2018
Vibrant colors!,Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!,5,21/06/2018

Great for animal lovers!,"Super cute, soft, and fuzzy...just like the woodland animals in the pattern. these loungers do run just slightly tight in the seat, so if you have a more developed bottom you should definitely get a size up.",4,15/08/2018
Who knew critters could be so cozy?,"I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously, how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear, but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft, comfy fabric. i",5,21/08/2018
Very nice christmas present!,I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.,5,23/07/2018
A little disappointing... :(,"Just got these today because they were a steal of a deal with the sale on sale. was super excited because the pattern is adorable! i put them on tonight and noticed that they, firstly, aren't eloise like i assumed they would be, and secondly, that they weren't as soft as i had expected. all of the retailer/eloise pajamas i have purchased in the past have been so soft and comfortable - you don't want to take them off! did i get an off pair that just happened to not be as soft? i'm not sure, but i'm",3,22/08/2018

Romantic top,This top is well made and the pleats give it a whimsical feel. i'm still debating on keeping it as it's slight boxy.,4,28/07/2018
Beautiful top ruined by styling,"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",2,27/05/2018
Feminine alternative to your shapeless puffer,I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh,4,04/10/2018

Great with leggings!,"I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!",4,06/03/2018
Too big/so soft,"I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure.",3,09/11/2018
"Comfy, but not made to last","This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase.",3,09/10/2018

Pills horribly,"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.",1,21/06/2018

Cutest leggings ever,These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.,5,30/10/2018
Love. love. love!,"My husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift. these leggings, let me tell you about these leggings!! so comfortable, so cute (buttons/color/pattern), love they way they feel on my legs. as soon as i get home from work i put them on (well, a lot of days). i am ordering another pair. i am someone who doesn't do leggings. i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy, that's how much i love them.",5,27/01/2018

Cozy for lounging,"Not my typical sleepwear, but glad that i took a chance, as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings), and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2""), though fits like in photos.",4,06/04/2018
Oh so cozy!,This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!,5,27/06/2018
Amazing!,"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.",5,04/02/2018
Great fit,"Noce color as well, only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality (it was pink and i tried on the grey). otherwise, nice and soft. regular size a little long and long sleeves, but sold out n petite :-(",5,07/12/2018
Comfy chic,"I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out, not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it, i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short, it fits well.",5,26/09/2018
Wanted to love,"I wanted to love this romper, but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium, decided to return. i still recommend trying this product, but it wasn't for me and my hips!",3,23/07/2018
"Great design, but poor quality","This romper fits well and is flattering. i love the relaxed style. the quality is quite poor, though. one leg ripped the second time i wore it and the fabric, while soft and comfortable, is fraying and pilling like crazy. after only two brief wears, the romper looks cheap and old. i expect much better quality at this pricepoint. really disappointed.",3,03/06/2018
Outdoor guilt,"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p",5,15/11/2018
A must have for every wardrobe!,"This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!",5,28/11/2018
Love it but....,Love everything about it but had to get a size bigger to be long an off/ to short for a mom. if i was 20 would be fine.,4,15/10/2018
Amazing!,"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took",5,24/05/2018
Beware when washing,"Wore this romper 1x and after washing, the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again, i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.",3,24/05/2018
Cute,"Nice fit, stretchy fabric, but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!",5,29/04/2018
Soft & great length,The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.,5,25/04/2018
Worth the money,"I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable, thick but not too warm. they are my 'nice' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i'm usually a large or xl.",5,08/03/2018
Comfy,"Nice feminine pattern with a thick fabric. it's great having pockets! the white is ivory. i'm a size 4, and the small fits nicely. it would be nice, if the pant length was a little longer. i have a 31"" inseam, and they end up being a couple of inches above my ankle, but that's just my preference. overall, very happy with this purchase.",5,31/08/2018
Perfect shorts!,"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.",5,27/09/2018
Great summer shorts,Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.,5,02/07/2018
I love them,Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.,5,07/12/2018
Stretches out,"I have 7 pair of pilcro denim shorts from retailer and for some reason the colored ones (white, yellow, pink) hold their shape but the denim blue completely stretch out. i went down a size in these and they still stretch to the point of sagging. i really want the black ones...hoping they don't do it too.",4,17/10/2018
Soft cute socks,"Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.",5,14/06/2018
A must for any morrissey fan :),I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didn't want to pay full price- i got it on sale and am so happy i did! it is super soft and comfy. it also fits perfectly- not too baggy but also not form fitting. as a moz fan i couldn't pass it up. awesome sweatshirt!,5,11/09/2018
Comfy top,"I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up",5,24/04/2018
"Nice shirt, shrunk a lot in length after washing","I like this shirt, as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however, after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts, bad if you are tall, like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top.",3,01/07/2018
"Cute, slightly uncomfortable",I am keeping these because the style is just cute as a button! ;) the button details on the ankle are so adorable. i would normally wear a size small but like the other reviews said they run small - i purchased the ml and they fit great. i wore them all day to work and they are slightly itchy....and during the day they would fall down and i would have to keep pulling them up. reminded me of when i was a little girl and my mom made me wear tights. however....they are too cute to not have. i will,4,20/11/2018
Great basic leggings!,"Soft, versatile comfort. what more could you want in a legging?",5,11/02/2018
Cute leggings but poor quality fabric.,"These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort, they are a five. but after only two wearings, they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price, i'd be more upset.",3,15/03/2018
Not ideal,I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,2,25/05/2018
Cute casual leggings,I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.,3,23/11/2018
Comfy leggings,These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.,5,08/08/2018
Love the color!,The raspberry color is really stunning! i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors. i was thrilled when i saw these! i've worn them once so far. very comfortable and seem like they will last.,5,22/10/2018
Perfect,These are the perfect tights-fit and feel are top quality and they wash well!,5,27/03/2018
My go to tights for another season,"I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts), stay put, and wear very well. these are well worth the price.",5,01/09/2018
Gorgeous! pics don't do them justice!,"I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!",5,22/04/2018
Most comfy flannel jammies ever,"Love, love these flannel sleep pants. i bought a pair 3 years ago and have been on the look out for the style again. these are truly the most comfortable pajama pants i have ever owned.",5,31/01/2018
Beautiful design,"These jammie pants are quite beautiful and comfortable. the material used is great, very light and thin. i found these to run really big though, definitely order a size down!!",4,14/08/2018
Love them!,"Exactly what i was looking for. cozy, not too warm, fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!",5,14/06/2018
Pleasant dreamy pjs,"I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didn't want to pay full price. the very next week, they went on sale! i ordered xs (i'm 5'4, small frame, 120lbs). while the length is perfect, the waist is a bit tight for pjs. though, not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these. they're like wearing a painting of fine art! light weight flannel. hope they hold up well iin cold water wash!",5,27/08/2018
Sleeping in comfort & beauty,"George venson of vousta has designed a pair of pajama bottoms that are beautifully designed & comfy to lounge & sleep in. they are a light weight flannel that fit true to size & wash extremely well. the design on these pj's are like no other; a white background with red birds. polar bears, deer, all with tree branches running through the length of the pant. they're just delightful. you must try them!",5,18/06/2018
Adorable whimsical soft wonderful,Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante -- soft cute fun,5,15/10/2018
Tea time sleep pant,I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.,5,29/10/2018
Live this,So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.,5,16/11/2018
So soft and comfy and fit for yoga!,"5'6"" 113lbs purchased size small in rich navy. so soft and comfy and i like that the cuffs help the pants not ride (even during sleep). i like that the fit is slim but not constricting on legs as all my yoga pants. tested this at my local vinyasa class and it held up without making me too hot (and i sweat a lot).

my biggest complaint is that the fabric pills right out of the packaging. actually their tag says the fabric does this and over time will continue to do this more and more because of i",4,14/05/2018
The most comfortable pants ever,I have these pants in navy and they're amazing! i cuff the hem in half and they look like joggers. they're ridiculously comfortable and tts but are not very thick so i'm pretty sure ivory would be see through; especially if you wear them during practice.,4,13/05/2018
Husband said it looked like a straight jacket,"This is way cuter on the model. it runs so big that it is very unflattering. perhaps on someone tall it would look better, but sadly it looked dumpy on my 5'2 frame. it also arrived with some black stain on it. it is going back.",2,26/11/2018
Great outerwear,"Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large., so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look, order down a size.",5,01/11/2018
This product adds volume.,This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.,3,27/02/2018
Soft and stylish,"Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans, while still maintaining an elegant look.",5,01/10/2018
Lovely quality,"A very pretty pair of over-the-knee socks. i purchased the dark grey color, which has a metallic silver thread running through it. a nice subtle but glitzy touch. the knitted pattern is intricate and nicely done. i'm 5' 4"" and they do come up well above the knee. if you are walking quite a bit, they don't stay above the knee, but they do seem to stay just below the knee. because the yarn is fairly thin they don't look bunchy even if they come down a bit. i have very sensitive skin, and metallics",4,28/02/2018
"Pretty pattern, weird texture",I love the design and pattern of this top. it runs big so an xs was roomy on me but still cute. the neck is wide. i returned it bc the material of the top isn't for me. the texture is too soft.,4,02/02/2018
Shorter than expected,"After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo, from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what",2,20/02/2018
Soft and unique but short sleeves,"Love this! easy to dress up and down, has a great length on the torso but the sleeves are about 2-3 inches from my wrist bone, i see why the model has them pushed/rolled up- which is how i wear the shirt now too. but then it's hard to layer under a coat.",4,01/03/2018
Soft but boxy,"I love the feel and design of this pullover. it is extremely soft and comfy to wear. however, i did find that it runs slightly large, is a bit boxy and the sleeves are a bit lengthy. probably not the best for a petite frame. i am trying to decide if i should keep it though simply for the softness and ease of wearing that it provides.",4,07/11/2018
Super comfy but very boxy,"I love this as a lounge-at-home top. the colors and pattern are really pretty, it's soft and warm. very comfy and cozy. but it's also boxy and thick so not a flattering cut.",4,28/11/2018
Cozy comfy beautiful top,I was initially attracted to the colors,5,09/10/2018
Love this sweater!,This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!,5,04/04/2018
Soft & warm,Warn and super soft. love it !,5,10/05/2018
Perfect pair of tights for winter!,"These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.",5,06/08/2018
Comfortable leggings,"These are perfect with a long tunic for the weekend to run errands! they are not tights-like in the sense that there's full coverage across your bum -- no accidental flashing of anyone. they're not itchy either. i bought these in brown, and want to buy the rest of the colors available!",4,27/03/2018
Cozy,Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.,5,08/11/2018
"Versatile, cozy, and fabulous!!!!","Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit",5,13/04/2018
Cute and comfy!,"I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't ""heavy"" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!",5,28/04/2018
Love these tights!,"Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.",5,07/04/2018
Great tights!,These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.,5,09/03/2018
Lovely material,These tights are comfortable and the material is great. i bought the gray and holly color and the colors are as shown online. similar to most nylon tights they snag easily. definitely not a legging and similar to other reviewers these won't keep you warm in the winter.,4,01/06/2018
Blue tights,Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.,5,14/08/2018
Cozy,"These tights are light but at the same time super cozy. definitely cut and sewn as tights and not meant to be worn as leggings -- they're really sheer around your rump. i've worn them around the house with oversized t-shirts and long sweaters. would only wear out of the house with a dress or serious coverage, despite what i thought when i bought them. i wish they were available in a few more colors. worth the sale price.",4,18/07/2018
Cute and simple,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top.",3,02/03/2018
Great under dresses,These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.,5,16/11/2018
Tights,"The color is great, a nice alternative to all my black tights. good quality.",5,17/05/2018
"Soft, comfy and well made!",I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.,5,14/08/2018
Love plaid,"Love these tights. fabric feels great, soft and comfy. took large so they fit perfectly at true waist for 5'6 height. some retailer tights i have bought in large, but they are too short for 5'6"" person.
the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.",5,30/06/2018
"As pictured, but not slimming as i hoped","These are cute, comfy and just as pictured; a soft greenish-gray but i didn't find them to be super flattering on me, or at least not slimming in my view. i'm 5'3"" about 105 lbs., and got them in s/m which fit just right, but they do go all the way up to my true waist. they are ""tube legs"", meaning they're not contoured tights. so there's excess fabric at the toe (it'd be all bunched in flats) and there's a tiny bit of looseness at the ankle. there's also no distinguishable front or back (and no",4,07/10/2018
Love these for fall!,"These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.",5,20/03/2018
So close...,"This is a fantastic sweater--really soft, great details. but it's huge. i'm generally between an xs and a s at retailer, and most always an xs with pure + good. but this time even the xs is huge! i wish they offered this one in an xxs. i love it so much that i may keep it anyway? it's really comfortable and i love the style. looks decent with my arms down (like the model's pose), but when my arms are lifted out to either side, it really looks huge. i'll have to think on this one.",3,24/02/2018
Dress up or down,"I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large, because they aren't too loose.",5,03/05/2018
Vegan suede leggings,"""vegan suede"" makes these sound fancier than they are. i love them and they're super cozy and a nice change from plain leggings, but they're just a microfiber legging which makes the price about 20 too high even for retailer. still... i'm sure i'll wear them plenty. i usually wear a 2-4 and the xs fit me, which makes me think they'd be too large for a size 0/xs.",4,05/09/2018
"So cozy, so fashionable",I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.,5,17/06/2018
Feel these socks!,"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.

you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?

these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li",5,02/02/2018
Super comfy,"Loved the way these felt but like the previous reviewer said it did run slightly large. i am usually a size 6 or m and the legs were a little baggy w/the medium. since the m is sold out i'm going to try and see if they shrink in the dryer. the color and design of the ankle is different from other leggings which is a plus. i'm 5'7"" and they are the perfect length.",4,10/03/2018
Review for fit only,"Nice but i thought these ran big. me: 28-29' waist, 36"" hips, athletic thighs. usually a medium in leggings but these size mediums were a bit baggy to my surprise. hoping to exchange for a size down as they are pretty, the ankle detail is fun and decently made.",4,04/12/2018
Love these,I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.,5,24/10/2018
Love`,"I love the pure and good short sleeve tees. they feel beautiful, and wash beautifully! i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time, i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips!",5,13/09/2018
Favorite tee,"These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...",5,06/10/2018
Soft basic tee,"I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!",5,28/02/2018
Flattering but bad quality,"I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body, but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.",3,13/09/2018
Best tee ever,"It drapes perfect and washes well. i own all the colors, they do not disappoint. i'm a medium.",5,14/03/2018
Soft & slinky,"It's lightweight, soft, & slinky, unike the average t-shirt. the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely.",5,07/07/2018
Nice staple t-shirt,"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts.",4,12/03/2018
Love the stretch,"The shorts have a linen look but have just a touch of stretch to them which is great for keeping their shape. i'm 5.7"" 140lbs and the shorts hit about 5"" down my thigh which is just long enough to cover but still sexy. the 29's fit but snug all over. the 30's gave a looser look but still fit in the waist. i have the navy and the mango. definitely recommend.",5,17/07/2018
Almost perfect... check sizing!,"I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them, the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy, on the other hand, was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no, it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28, hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or",5,21/11/2018
Pricey for shorts but worth it,"I bought these on a whim on mother's day when i was out shopping. i didn't try even try them on at the store. i got them home and couldn't believe how great they fit and how comfortable they were. the length is perfect for me. not too long or too short. they did stretch out a bit upon wearing them but i like the comfortable, relaxed look. i washed and dried them in the dryer. they came out perfect. i bought the coral color. will be buying more as it is hard to find shorts that work for me. i rec",5,09/03/2018

The best shorts!,"I am obsessed with these shorts. i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair. i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue, even with my pale legs. i think they will be very versatile. the fit is perfect!! hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate, not too short. super comfy. i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find, and these are truly amazing. i can't wait to wear them when it gets warmer! for reference i am 5' 4"" about",5,06/09/2018
I wanted to fit to work!,"I tried this top on today because i was really hoping i could get the shorts and robe set. the shirt was softer than i was expecting, but when i tried it on it was an uncomfortable fit. there was some tightness in the armpit area, which is not where i would have expected it to be tight. the rest of it was comfortable and reasonable looseness so i don't think a size up would have been a good option for me. i like the design a lot so i was really disappointed it didn't fit. it is between a lightwe",4,24/06/2018
Checkerboard sleep top,I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.,4,07/12/2018
Comfy,"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms, bought size m/l
very cute pattern on the grey leggings, and the fleece lining is warm. they are thick too, so even stretched they are not see through. i would say 14 would be as large as these bottoms would fit as they are snug, but fine for wearing under skirts and dresses.",4,26/08/2018
Not as listed,Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,1,02/12/2018
Perfect,"These leggings are so warm and comfortable. they're thick enough to wear as pants, and they don't stretch and slide during the day. i wish they came in more colors!",5,10/11/2018
Great fleece lined leggings....,"I'm about 130 lbs. and 6' tall and usually a small would be my size. these fit, but i would be more comfy in a m. they are stretchy, soft and opaque. perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer!!! will be re-ordering.",5,02/03/2018
Great leggings!,"I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that's how happy i am with this purchase!",5,09/06/2018
Awesome leggings,"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly, and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!",5,28/01/2018
Excellent product,These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!,5,05/02/2018
Amazing!,"These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!",5,01/02/2018
Super itchy!,Super itchy! had to return.,1,04/02/2018
Not as thick as you think,"I was expecting these to be the normal thickness of everyday leggings, plus fleece. instead, they're more like thicker-than-average tights. still warm, though there's a weird seam on the inside of the thighs that takes away from some of the comfort. not so bad that i want to return them, but not what i was hoping for, either.",4,21/11/2018
So comfortable!,These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.,5,15/05/2018
"New ""hot pants"" for winter leggings",I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.,5,27/06/2018
Comfortable,Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.,5,24/05/2018
Glorious,"These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!",5,12/07/2018
Too big,"I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a ""draft."" they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit.",3,15/05/2018
"Affordable, soft, warm leggings","I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for",5,04/02/2018
Great deal,Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.,5,17/09/2018
Comfy and cute,Really comfortable leggings! not see through and at a great price!,5,24/10/2018
Perfect cold weather leggings!,"These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, i'm so happy with these!",5,29/04/2018
Great leggings,"These leggings are a quality product at a great price! i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them. warm and comfy, she wears them all the time.",5,16/07/2018
Super purchase!,"I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!",5,05/10/2018
So amazing,"From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it.",5,12/06/2018
Maybe not for the tall,"I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite.",3,27/02/2018
Comfy and warm,These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.,5,16/09/2018
Smells awful,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,1,08/04/2018
Very feminine,"After surviving the winter months in various combo's of flannel and wool, i was craving something feminine to wear for lounging and sleeping while traveling the mediterranean with a friend. this little gown looked ideal. the lace is very feminine, and smoother than i feared. i reserved a single star over concern that the jersey knit of the body won't hold up to the test of time. it is not sheer, rather just opaque enough so i won't be self conscious. the curved, high waist is flattering.
regardi",4,01/03/2018
Adorable !,I saw this in the store and had to try it on. luckily i grabbed a couple sizes before heading to the dressing room since i thought it looked large but wanted to get the best look. i normally wear a large in most retailer items and if you want a really roomy look you could go for your normal size but i liked it a little more fitted and ended up getting a small. i plan to wear it over jeans or leggings. the delicate embroidery and details are so pretty. the stick out sides look a little funny but if,4,25/06/2018
Soft and sweet,"This dress is very soft and comfy but transparency is an issue. having said that, i think as long as you wear flesh-colored undergarments you'd be fine in a casual situation. the natural fiber is especially comfortable and the detailed stitching around the neck and chest area is pretty. my store didn't have petite sizes and the regular length was too long for me so i passed on it.",4,25/02/2018
Lovely cami,"Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!",5,28/06/2018
Soft and beautiful,"Looks better in person than the pictures online. very soft and comfortable. if you are between sizes, size down. it is roomy with a lot of material that drapes in the front. just know that this sweater is short in the back and does not cover your backside.",5,04/08/2018
Cozy,Bought as a gift. really soft and cozy. i am sure she will love it!,5,12/08/2018
So comfortable,I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :),5,05/04/2018
Great travel piece,"The pictures don't do this justice. it's so beautiful on. drapes incredibly. the cream color is a warm, creamy bright off white. looks really nice. incredibly comfortable. i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes. super cozy and chic. a must have.",5,02/12/2018
Comfy but not cohesive,"This product is incredibly comfy and perfect for getting cozy however the sleeves were sort of loose and did not look cohesive with the grey. props on the draping though, that was lovely.",3,26/03/2018
Cozy in the front,"The front material is soft and cozy, but i was surprised to find that the back and the arms were a waffle knit, like long john material, very thin and tight in the arms. cannot wear a shirt underneath it, only tank top. other than that, it's a great deal",4,22/03/2018
Cozy wrap sweatshirt,"First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second, i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also, he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it, but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa",2,09/02/2018
A dream,"This sweater is a dream come true for me. when i first spotted it during the 40% off sale, i didn't place my order in time to receive one. but then it came back a few weeks later, and i snatched one up! needless to say, the disappointment and wait was well worth it.

the material is incredibly soft, the fit is just about right (i'm a size xs at retailer, without fail, and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i have).

a few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e",5,18/10/2018
Great product,Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,5,07/02/2018
Beautiful but a very difficult fit,"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2, if not 0. 

the bust is probably a 34 a or b, or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well, but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it, so i will return it. 

the fabric, design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality.",3,05/06/2018
Very pretty swimsuit,"This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because, despite how much i liked the style, it just wasn't flattering on my body type.",3,09/11/2018
"Comfy, well made, not crazy about the fit","Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe, but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft, cozy, and cute, though.",3,04/12/2018
Softest robe,"This robe is warm, soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!",5,22/06/2018
Not a great fit,This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way. did not like the way that it fit. returned,2,02/08/2018
Plaid sherpa robe rocks!,Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!,5,18/06/2018
Better than expected!,Very nicely made with attention to detail. thick and comfy. hand washing recommended. that's the only negative.,4,10/07/2018
Great summer staple,"These fit quite well, and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.",5,29/06/2018
Great look & fit!,"Love these shorts. i purchased them in the peach color. the color is perfect, the fit is perfect, they look great. highly recommend!",5,17/11/2018
Love,"First time trying pilcro, but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!",5,16/03/2018
Very sheer and not as form fitting,"I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes, the top and bottoms fit overall, but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work, which i am willing to work on s",3,25/07/2018
Poor bust design,"As a petite, big busted woman, i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful, though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however, i found unflattering.",3,13/05/2018
Too boxy,"If the sweater looked as it does in the picture, i would keep it. however, it was very boxy and short, a style that does not work for me at all. i'm 5 ft. 6 in. and ordered the medium. i suspect the sweater on the model may be clipped back to make it look more form fitting. unfortunately i will have to return the sweater.",3,13/02/2018
Just right,"I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.",5,20/10/2018
Motif over-the-knee socks,"This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles, but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.",5,09/05/2018
"Beautiful, but narrow","I really like the look of these socks, and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing, because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however, by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.

i am still",3,03/08/2018
Lovely socks,"These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.",5,25/06/2018
Could not get it over my calves,These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.,1,11/04/2018
Too narrow,"These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",2,28/10/2018
Warm and attractive but too tight/narrow and short,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.,2,21/06/2018
"""perfect with jeans""",Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.,5,24/04/2018
Beautifully created,"Lovely socks, great color, stitched well, a little thin",5,12/05/2018
Small but cute,"I have 9.5-10 size feet, and these are a bit small; the heel doesn't quite make it around my heel to where it's supposed to be. still, they're comfy and not too thick or too warm. i really like the stripes of different patterns. good trouser socks. i imagine if you're size 7 or 8 these will fit perfectly. i got the mint and the pink colors, and they're very true to how they appear on my computer screen.",4,09/06/2018
I purchased the purple color,"Cute socks, very comfy as well. good quality in person.",4,25/07/2018
Beautiful tights,These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.,5,30/09/2018
Comfortable and beautiful!,"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).

i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!

two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.",5,05/09/2018
"Comfy and cute, high quality socks","I love these socks so much! i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks. these are comfy, with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion. however, the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff! i want to order more, but i don't care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered. instead, i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next!",5,11/02/2018
So comfy! great for pajamas or super casual,"I love these! they are cute enough to wear out, and they are really comfortable. i ordered a small and at 5'3"" they are a little long but they shrunk in the wash and they're still totally wearable",4,19/03/2018
Love!!,"Comfy, cozy, and great bargain for the sale price.",5,11/04/2018
Comfy but see through,"I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum, but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through, so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top, they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer, but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately, these fall in the latter category.",3,05/12/2018
Perfect cotton jogger,Quality assembled;comfortable and stylish with 2-tone fabric; wash w/o shrinkage;pair with every rainbow color. nice alternative to jean days.,5,13/11/2018
Super cute & comfy,My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.,5,08/06/2018
Soooo comfy,"These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it.",5,04/12/2018
So comfy yet stylish,I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it's comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!,5,08/11/2018
Comfy yet unattractive,"I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy, yet unshapely. after the initial wear, the product begins to stretch out, and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft, but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely, but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a",3,23/11/2018
Love it but wish i could tweak a bit.....,"Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy 

 the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b",5,09/10/2018
Great colors but wrong for me,I love the quality and colors of this romper; however i have a long torso and the top part was just too short for my body style. it made the bottom part pull as well. overall the fit just wasn't right for me. i did love the material and it is a very nice piece.,3,28/03/2018
Boxy moo moo,"Disappointed :-(
this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me. i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me. bummer! i liked the quality and weight (not too heavy nor too light) but shape is unflattering. it's going back.",2,06/04/2018
Great staple,"I bought navy in my usual size s, and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens), i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable, warm and stylish. great staple, well made and well priced.",5,26/05/2018

Great comfy dress!,"I received this dress in both colors (oatmeal and blue) for christmas, and i love them! they are super comfortable and great with leggings. i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church. i am 5'10 and 140 lbs and i got the small. it fits true to size. i would definitely recommend!",5,30/05/2018
Perfect nightshirt,"Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!",5,10/02/2018

Chic and casual cotton comfort.,"Wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots. pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace. for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals. received numerous compliments wearing the first time, so purchased the navy one several weeks later. anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown. love",5,25/11/2018
Nice enough item on sale with discount,"Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color, so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly, the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.",2,08/02/2018
Super comfy!,"I was so excited for this to come in the mail, once i got it and opened it up i actually went back to verify this was in fact pajamas! it is great quality and super soft! some positives were that it has pockets! (who knew?!) and like stated before it is super soft and comfortable. the only negative is that it is not physically attractive, it is very baggy and it a-lines out. it's fine its pajamas but if you are wanting something cute for bed and you have a straight body this may not be the answe",4,23/06/2018

Love this jacket!,"Got the jacket in blue xs, i am 5-1, 110 lbs. fits great and wanted the beige one too! however the beige color ones have a totally different fit! the beige jackets run big and i was swimming in the xs, hence the mixed reviews from other peeps.",5,29/10/2018
Order your usual size!!,"So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!",5,21/07/2018
Sizing depends on the comor,"I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big
i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.
when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.
however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.
either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.",5,02/04/2018
Great jacket,"Just bought this jacket on sale and i love it! it's like a soft compfy sweatshirt , love the longer length. i feel like it runs pretty true to size. i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine. the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad, the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that. i would highly recommend this jacket, just love the feel and look of it.",5,22/08/2018

Fits tts & small & large,"This great casual jacket has a confusing fit but if you know what you want and understand the style, you can be surely happy with this plush & smooth stadium coat. first, the neutral/beige fits a little easier but it is definitely larger in the body compared to the navy. for both colors the shoulders and sleeves are fitted (perhaps a little tight) while the body has an a-line flare and subtle hi-lo hem. the neutral really flares out a lot while the blue is a gentle flare. if you have narrow shou",4,18/08/2018
"Great, runs small","I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.",5,13/02/2018
Cozy but huge,"This coat is really nice and cushy and warm, but it runs very very large. i am about 5'7"", 150 lbs and i ordered a medium and i probably should have ordered an xs because it was ginormous. i returned it in favor of another jacket. i'm sure i would have loved it if it were smaller but i found something i liked more in the interim. it's also a little bit darker in person. just a little bit, i was expected it to be more creme white and it was like a tan.",4,16/07/2018
Just buy it,"Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version.",5,29/03/2018
So comfy,"This is a very comfy dress/tunic. i like to wear it with leggings. washed well, nice color, looks nice with boots. nice find!",5,27/06/2018
Picture doesn't do it justice,"This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldn't believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6, 32 h bra)and the small was perfect. can't wait to wear it!",5,04/10/2018
Love it!,Very pleased with my purchase! the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance. very soft and comfortable; definitely recommend!,5,28/08/2018

L space chloe top,"L space is frustrating. i wear a 0/2 top but with 32d's i tried a large in this bikini top because from past experience with l space they run small. there's just zero support. the tie design helps secure the girls in place, but also flattens them out if you tie it tight enough so you don't spill out.",3,12/08/2018
Runs small,"I'm 5'7"", 125 lbs and i ordered these in a size small. i just got them in the mail and the print is really pretty and they seem very well-made. unfortunately, they were a little too small, particularly around my butt. after i ordered them, i read reviews on other merchants' websites and saw that many other stores recommend sizing up, as the brand is known to run small. i wish i had known before i ordered, but i'm exchanging them for a medium and i hope those fit better, because this suit is ador",4,27/07/2018
L space estella hipsters,The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.,3,23/01/2018
"Beautiful graphic design, very small!","Although $$$$$ i want to support usa products and am so glad retailer continues to add these options .i also decided to splurge with family coming home for the holidays, a way to stay in pajamas but still look dressed. i am only 5'2"" and these were just longer than capri length, more like the close-up view online. to get them ankle length you would have to push them way down on your hips, not sure how the tall model did that! i am 106 lbs and considered exchanging the xs for an s, these run",4,04/09/2018
Runs small but cute,"These pants are really cute but definitely run small - i ordered a large so they would be a little bigger for lounging and they are not very stretchy. the large fits more like a small in regular sweatpants. there is more blue visible in the top and bottom part of the pants as well, which i like.",4,12/11/2018
Add a little shimmer to your outfit,"These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.",5,04/09/2018
So comfortable,"Great style and cut, love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts, unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.",5,17/02/2018
Comfy,"The pattern ""camouflages"" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft, great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out.",4,20/04/2018
Else lingerie jardin silk bralette review,This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.,5,09/04/2018
Confortable,I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.,5,05/09/2018
Can't resist hot air balloons!,"I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.",5,23/07/2018
Wanted to love it,"I wanted to love this set, but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.",3,24/03/2018
Must see in person,"A whim of a purchase on a tops sale. i spotted the black, but went for the mauve. it's great in person, fits loosely and hangs nicely for layering. i will buy the black too when in goes on sale. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame, and the small was perfect (and every a little roomy) on me.",5,11/05/2018
Fun ;),"This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.",5,12/09/2018
Scooped knit slip,Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,2,14/03/2018
Beautiful,This is a beautiful piece for the price. very well made and flattering. i'm a 34c and usually wear a size 2-4 on top and solid size 4 on bottom. a size small in this fit great. it does not provide any support up top though so be aware of that.,4,30/03/2018
Beautiful. great quality. low cut bottom :/,I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(,5,11/08/2018
Super cute,"Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out, which i'm bummed about, but matched it with a funky black top.",5,05/05/2018
Great top- bottoms run super small - order up,"Great fun pattern. sexy styling. the other reviewers commented on how the trim is white and the body is ivory- i actually liked that. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i usually wear a 4 and ordered a medium in this suit. bottom was super small and is sold out in large so i had to return it",4,13/09/2018
Such a comfy piece!,"These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.",5,13/10/2018
Beware: they're sheer,"I got these in the neutral color & quickly understood why they're categorized as ""loungewear"". if you're going to wear them out of the house, wear a tunic or a dress over them. i folded the scrunch part up over my calves & wore them like boot socks when i went out. i got a m/l & they fit about on par with other leggings / tights of that size range.

when i got home, i rolled them down & put the bottoms over my heels. the rest of the bottoms scrunched around my ankles. i recommend them for around",4,07/04/2018
"Good product, comfortable",On the advice of other reviewers i purchased the m/l in this item. boy was i happy i did. i am normally a size 6-8 and because of the sheerness issue mentioned by another reviewer i purchased the larger size. they are still sheer in the rear end. you must wear a tunic or longer shirt/skirt with these. if you are hanging around the house it is not too bad. these are very comfortable and feel great while wearing. the color is great and the look is good. they are really long when you remove them fr,4,21/03/2018
Love these!,"Bought this as ""transitional"" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting.",5,24/05/2018
"See-through, but worth it.","I am a 5'10"" size 4 (or 28 long - i need a 33-34"" inseam) woman. i bought the s/m and they fit perfectly (with all the excess length bunching at my ankles, as designed)! i'm thrilled. i bought the light color. one thing, wear nude underwear and lighter (or just short) socks - these are definitely see-through! however, i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways - something always reaching down to my upper thighs, at least. so comfy and cozy!",5,08/02/2018
Long legs required,"Nice quality, but enough material for two sets of tights. can scrunch up at the bottom for a different look.",4,29/07/2018
Love the ribbed sweaterknit leggings,"They're great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn't have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job!",5,07/09/2018
Cozy and fun!,"I love these with tunics and little dresses! they hit at a funny place on my hips, though; i wish they were a bit higher-up. since the waistband is thick, they show through tops unless they are pulls up above my hips, and they're a bit too short-waisted for that. but i was able to stretch them a bit, and i love them!",4,16/05/2018
Wonderful cozy feeling,"Absolutely love these leggings - warm, comfortable - great way to relax after a long day? snuggle up in these...do stretch even longer after a while, but wash and wear again is easy - even wear out of the house...bought in green and love how well they go with sweaters, shirts, etc. -",5,17/11/2018

Awkward. just awkward.,"I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it, making it even harder to get off. it was returned.",2,22/09/2018
Low quality for price,"This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable",2,21/02/2018
Beautiful design,"This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette",5,16/04/2018
Nice warm tights,"These tights have a nice pattern and color. they look just like the photograph. they are warm and because they are warm they have wool in them and they are a little itchy. but, that's the price you pay for warmth. i own several pairs of retailer tights and love the patterns (foxes, scotty dogs, and now trees). .",4,01/03/2018

Flowing beach dress,"I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups, i always imagine the sounds of the birds, waves rolling in, and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality, of course, is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo",5,11/06/2018
Quality and whimsy,"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small",5,14/11/2018
Add a little fun!,"These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l",5,25/09/2018
I wanted to love them,"Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went.",2,20/02/2018
Need petite sizing,"These tights are so cute, but the sizing leaves much to be desired. i guess they are true to size since they are labeled s/m.

i'm 5'0"" with shorter legs than torso, and i suppose i'm lucky that i have muscular (read: large) quads/thighs to suck up some of the fabric, otherwise these might have just bunched up at my ankles.

the other thing i don't love about them is the feel of the fabric - it's more sweater-like (and not a soft sweater) than stretchy. maybe that was the intent, but i find tigh",4,24/10/2018
So fun!,These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!,5,08/07/2018
Versatile,"I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough",5,24/04/2018
So flattering!,"I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3, 32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.",5,06/05/2018
Slip pass this one,"A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.",1,16/06/2018
"Flattering style, too small","I love the way the mock neck style looks, but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch, but it's still very, very tight on, particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style, i'd recommend sizing up.",3,21/09/2018
Great for around the house!,"I understand what the previous reviewer meant when she says these are great for around the house. the yarn is thick but the weave is open so they are nicely springy but not very warm.

Love!,I love these socks! they are super thick and comfy. the quality feels great and they were cheap!,5,17/11/2018
Great for around the house but nothing else,"These are just some classic ""around the house"" type socks. they're not comfortable enough to wear with some boots or anything. just super snuggly and soft for lounging purposes only. i love them and am contemplating buying the other pair. i got the blue and white ones to go with the farrier tee in blue and white. i'm kind of bummed that i can't wear these anywhere but no worries. they'll be great with some joggers and a sweatshirt while i work the crossword over a cup of coffee. would recommend",4,21/08/2018
Non-existent waistband,"Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.",1,10/02/2018
Waist falls down!,"I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so, of course, back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.",2,16/05/2018
"Stylish, warm, comfy . . . but, oops!","I love these leggings - they look and feel great, but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband, so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out, for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style, comfort, and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.",3,07/07/2018
No elasticity :(,"I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.",1,01/07/2018
Warm but problems,"I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool, soft, not itchy, light weight, lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th",3,18/05/2018
"Warm and soft, but stretchy","I received these as a christmas gift. they are really cozy: warm, soft and super comfortable. however, they stretch out a lot, as there is no drawstring or elastic on the waist band. this leads them to poof out a lot and i have to keep pulling them up. this is fine for hanging out around the house, but not if you want to wear them out and about. i'm keeping them because they're so comfortable, but beware how much they stretch. (i am 5'6"", 130 lbs and the size small fits well).",3,27/07/2018
Too big and baggy,"I love the fabric and design of these leggings, but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.",3,07/08/2018
Poor fit!,"So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~",1,20/09/2018
Get these if you want to run around bare-bottomed!,"I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!",1,04/03/2018
"Cute, but not the length advertised","I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs, normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact, the elastic is very loose, not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on, given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run",3,22/07/2018

Not sure what body type this suit is designed for,"I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.",1,15/07/2018
"Gorgous design, poor fit",This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,2,03/07/2018

Love *almost* everything about it,"This suit is well made, and is so darn cute. i usually wear a 6, but i am a size 8 in this (8 us size, although the main tag is australian size. they send out based on the us size ordered). the only issue i have is that i have a long-ish torso compared to my size, so it's ever so slightly tight in the crotch, but not enough to make me send it back. i have small boobs, so the extra padding is nice. i'm and athletic 5'6"" and 130 lbs.",4,23/03/2018
"Cute print, but didn't fit quite right","This was such an adorable print that even though it was a bit pricey i decided to splurge! alas, the fit just wasn't good. it didn't look good on me and bunched up in all the wrong places. sadly, i had to return it. i've bought swimsuits from seafolly before and recommend the brand due to the high quality, unfortunately this particular style just didn't look that good on me.",4,26/08/2018
Confidence builder,I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!,5,27/09/2018
So flattering!,"I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever.",5,21/06/2018
Flattering,"I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 12 in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 12 for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!",5,11/06/2018
Super cute and flattering,"I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size, which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd, around 130 pounds, and 5'5"" and a size 6 fits perfectly.",5,07/12/2018
Good for d cups,This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.,5,05/11/2018
Runs super small,"Holy cow does this run small-like really small. i ordered the normal size i would wear and couldn't even get it passed my legs-until i supplied the most amount of effort i could (against my better judgment) and managed to get it on-but it was definitely too small. i would classify myself as petite and my normal size was way too short on my torso. it, of course, was a mistake to force it on because it was just as hard to get it off.

Stunning one piece suit,"I just received this beautiful suit. i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved it!

Great suit for many body types,"I felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs, 34d and normally wear a size 4 (give or take). i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did! if you're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up, go up one more, especially if you're bigger up top. mine fit *okay* in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup. what's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you can't remove them without cutting",4,26/04/2018
Love love love!!,"Hesitant at first to spend so much on a swimsuit. definitely worth the money, quality all around..style..fit. appreciated the review i read prior to purchase, to size up! so happy i was able to get it on sale as well! $120.00 roughly but can see why it cost so much!",5,09/05/2018
Great vintage inspired bathing suit,"I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.",5,27/11/2018
Favorite pjs,"I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight, soft, good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.",5,19/06/2018
"Beautiful, lightweight lounge pants","These pants are just as beautiful in person as on the website. the fabric is luxuriously soft. two things to note: they are very lightweight jersey material, and they run a bit small. if you're in between sizes, you might want to size up. it's possible they'll stretch while wearing. i also wish they had pockets, but they just have a one small back pocket that's not sewn down and seems made for perhaps a tissue but nothing else. all of these ""flaws"" are made up for by the fact that these are abso",4,15/03/2018
Perfect pj's!,"I cannot say enough about these pajama pants. they're beautiful and crazy comfortable. it's a nice change from black or grey. i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me. i wanted a petite l because i am short, but the regular large is fine. i just wear them higher up on my hips. i normally wait for sales on sleepwear, but i couldn't resist on these. they're well worth the investment!",5,12/06/2018
"Luxuriously soft , beautiful lounge pants","So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft, and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5'5 , 125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won't regret. also , finally - perfect length .",5,30/10/2018
Love,"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.",5,04/02/2018
Perfect dress,"I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.",5,13/08/2018
Cute and sporty,Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.,2,26/04/2018
"Very pretty, comfortable","This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine, but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support, especially for an unlined bra, and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.",5,25/03/2018
"A supportive, comfy bralette? actually, yes.","I'm a 32dd, so i wouldn't normally wear a bralette out of the house (not enough support). this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable. i'm probably going to get at least one more. for reference, i'm a 32dd (small back, big boobs) and a small fit me extremely well.",5,24/08/2018
Pretty but not perfect,"This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back, and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping, and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this, but as it is i will keep the one",3,20/04/2018
Beautiful & comfortable w/perfect fit,"Only the xxs was left, so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference, i'm 32c, 5'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color, along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable, too. love so much i, ordering more!",5,30/11/2018
Nice jacket!,I saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful! it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy. this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring. highly recommend.,5,23/07/2018
Such a great staple!,I just bought this jacket for my mom to take with her on a trip to europe. it is perfect! perfect packing piece that doesnt wrinkle and is a substantial enough weight to wear on chilly evenings. considering buying an additional one in my size...,5,05/02/2018
Didn't work out,"Nice weight and loved the design, but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos, but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided, so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold",3,01/12/2018
Quality jacket,"Like the other reviewer said, there's a nice inner lining, and the material of the jacket is just so nice. looks a little like a blazer when worn, but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece.",5,20/02/2018
Adorable as a regular top not sleep,I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!,5,28/02/2018
Unflattering,Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.,1,15/10/2018
Cozy and stylish,"I love this cardigan! its fit, however, really depends a lot on an individual's height and build. i am about 150 lbs. i have slim arms and am larger in the chest. my typical size in retailer clothing is m. having said that, i found that in this top a s fit best. it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay. the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed. wearing leggings or slim pants (ex. pilcro cords) gave a much more flattering look to my backside. jeans...not so muc",5,07/12/2018
My new favorite cardigan,"This is the softest cardigan i own. perfect for lounging, going to / from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf. i've worn it buttoned or open, and receive many compliments. i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment : )",5,30/04/2018
Not for the curvy,"I ordered this piece online and returned it at the store a few days after arrival. the material is very soft and well made. however it is not flattering on the hourglass or pear shaped person. moreover, if you are short, the design may make you look shorter. i am 5'4"" and it did to me. the design is beautiful. if you are tall and have narrow hips, this is the piece for you. i am 5'4"", 160lbs and usually wear a s/m.",4,20/02/2018
Amazingly comfy,"I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!",5,05/10/2018
Wanted to love this!,"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s",5,10/02/2018
Love this thing :),"I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece",5,28/01/2018
Very cute!,This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.,3,07/04/2018
Really enjoy this cardigan,"I love the cardigan. it's super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it's a little tight in the arms. i'm right between a small and medium, i wish i would have ordered the medium.",5,05/04/2018
Great cardigan,Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.,5,23/10/2018
Best bathing suit!,"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.",5,29/01/2018
My new favorite swim suit,"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",5,01/04/2018
Perfect suit,"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small.",5,17/02/2018
Great suit for busy moms!,This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.,5,21/08/2018
Wonderful swimsuit,"This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.",5,27/07/2018
The perfect swimsuit - functional and stunning!,"This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d",5,01/02/2018
Perfection,"I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6"",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go",5,20/07/2018
Amazing suit!,"This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!",5,02/04/2018
Cute and comfortable swimsuit!,"This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.",5,09/08/2018
Lacks support,"Great swimsuit, love the fabric and pattern. the top lacks support.",4,10/03/2018
Comfortable and flattering,"This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it's probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?",5,05/04/2018
Great fit,This top is awesome! it fits well and has a flattering shape. it's true to size and i love it!,5,07/03/2018
"Delightful, different, gets dirty asap","I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top. 

here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom, though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let",2,30/03/2018
This will not fit bustier women,"I so wanted to love the striped peplum top, however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)",2,03/11/2018
"Love, love, love","Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.",5,21/07/2018
Not for the long waisted,Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return,3,26/01/2018
"Lovely, flattering, comfortable",It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect,5,16/09/2018
Not cute,Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.,2,28/09/2018
"Wanted to love it, but it's too short",I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.,2,01/08/2018
This product fits well,"I love this top! it's so hard for me to find conservative, comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it's comfortable and soft and great quality. i'm excited to use this suit this season!",5,14/10/2018
Size l is true to size and flattering,"Swimsuit shopping can be the worst. it's difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering. this swim top is a winner. the straps are comfortable, and the scoop in the front was not too low for a 36d cup. the best part is the higher back! a lot of swimwear dips in the back, but this does not (read: eliminates the dreaded back fat). my only concern was that it isn't super supportive for larger busts, but i'm keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall. this wou",5,13/06/2018
Fantastic fit!,"This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute ""lounge at the lake"" ensemble.",5,11/11/2018
Not dissapointed,"The weight and feel of this jacket is what i was hoping for. it is medium weight making it my go to on cool days and is also very flattering to wear...it actually gives you shape! i like the front texturing on the scroll work and the pockets are well placed. if anything could be different, i would have preferred a little more room in the sleeves as they run slightly snug so not made to wear with anything with bulk, but overall not an issue.",4,09/07/2018
Leisure wear,"I loved the design of these pants, and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up, as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.",3,12/05/2018
Nice spin on leggings,"I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too ""matchy"". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!",5,30/11/2018
Very cute and comfortable,"These are so cute... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these. i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium. these are also lower price than i expected. also, well constructed. thank you antho!!",5,23/09/2018
Super comfortable and surprisingly warm,"I received this for christmas this year and have already worn it several days in a row. it is warm enough to wear while walking the dog in the snow and can also be worn to lounge around the house.

the only reason i didn't rate it a 5 is due to the design fact that it doesn't have pockets. i don't love to carry a purse around all of the time so i use my coat pockets a lot. regardless though i would definitely recommend this especially for the price. i was expecting to come here and see this pric",4,29/01/2018
Very cute and comfy,"This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute, soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck, pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered 2 sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a 2 petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m",5,28/02/2018
Wonderfully soft jacket,"Love the asymmetrical zipper, style, fabric and color. so soft, comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!",5,07/09/2018
Product has holes in the pocket area,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,1,26/01/2018
Great jacket,"Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket.",5,11/05/2018
"Cute, elegant, and warm","Hi,

like the other reviewers, i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm, yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out, so buy now if you want it.",5,08/10/2018
In love!,"I absolutely love this jacket! it is the softest jacket i own. the collar takes this to the next level. i wasn't sure i would like the collar but after trying it on, i love it. i'm so confused as to why the pockets are partially sewn together. it's weird but according to the other reviews, i am hoping to open the pockets up completely. i really should have gotten a medium in this coat. i am usually between a small and medium and this is a little on the smaller side. i bought this one on sale so",5,29/09/2018
Cozy,These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.,5,29/01/2018
Too transparent,"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material, although comfortable, is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these, the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore, these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white, at that), so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature",2,03/02/2018
Cute vest x2,"Fell in love at first site, cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure.",5,09/08/2018
Buy this before it sells out!,"I've gotten so many compliments on this super adorable vest! it's soft & comfortable and the fit is very flattering. i have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because for $130 i'd expect there to be no loose threads all over the place, but it's easy to forget about those when you realize how dang cute it is!",4,06/10/2018
Beautiful!,"This vest was a must-have the minute i saw it! i usually stick to the sale section, but this was a worthy exception. i love the reversible option! i bought the matching leggings as well, and have worn them with the smaller floral motif...so many compliments! i teach barre, so i figured i would wear this to and from the studio, but i find myself reaching for it to go over all my regular clothes too! the only draw back is the zipper. i'm sure its because it is reversible, however, the zipper hasn'",5,10/08/2018
Form and function,Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,5,05/02/2018
Super cute,Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.,5,13/09/2018
So pretty!,"I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still
fit. overall the medium was more flattering on me. so i recommend ordering your regular size. it is such a pretty v",5,17/06/2018
The perfect vest,I've wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now. the material is perfect and the colors are amazing. it's definitely a vest that you can wear all year. i would 100% recommend this.,5,24/08/2018
So many compliments,"...on this great vest. i wear it all the time. it's soft, pretty, warm and durable. love!",5,01/08/2018
Amazing vest!!!,"I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute, great transition piece into spring.",5,28/07/2018
Aquaflora vest,"So much prettier in person. love it! i'm a size 2 in retailer and a small in this vest, even over a sweater still left quite a bit of room.",5,10/08/2018
Great lil vest,"Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego, i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on, but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible, i guess it's worth it! (treat yo'self!)",5,04/02/2018
Wonderful!!,"Purchased this today at my local retailer-been eyeing it a while-thinking i would wait until on sale-until the salesgirl whom i know said it was their second shipment and all have sold out. knew i needed to splurge. i tried on the small and x small and wound up going for the small. i did however try on 3 smalls and two of them were way to roomy, but the third one fit like a charm-it was quite a bit slimmer in body than the two smalls, strange but true. i do have room in it-i am a 32 c to 36 b and",5,24/08/2018
Classic tee,"I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i am typically a size xs/s or 2/4 in all retailer tops. however, this brand (velvet) runs small. i had to order a size medium. the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck! the fabric is very soft and a little thin. i am a little concerned how it is going to wash, it seems a little delicate. but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it. i ordered the black (classic",5,08/06/2018
Not for me,"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun, and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also, not as comfortable as they looked, the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me, though the pants were in the correct size.",3,13/03/2018
Adorable,"These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!",5,11/09/2018
Comfortable but not super-flattering on me,"I tried these on at the store and the fit was good, the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton, which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs, so it wasn't ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half.",4,05/09/2018
Comfy pants,"These pants overall are very comfortable, but have an unusual fit. they tend to run a bit short, and i always have to get pants hemmed shorter, so if you have long legs or like more draping, you probably won't like these. they also ran a bit large in the waist and thigh, a bit puffy, i had to size down in order to get a good fit. very good quality, and cute design.",4,05/12/2018
Comfy and cute,"My size was not available so based on reviews stating the bagginess of a certain area, i sized down and glad i did. i never size down because i do not like tight clothing, especially casual wear. nice muted print and good quality terry material. recommend, but size down if you want a more fitted feel.",4,18/09/2018
Awkward fit for me,"Love the way these pants look in the pictures, great quality, but the style isn't really me. i gave it a try, so that's what counts!",4,17/08/2018
Very comfy!,"I orderd this product in a size large, because i was afraid of it being seamless would make it too tight on my larger chest (32ddd), however the opposite happened. because it doesn't have any kind of seams it is very boxy and not skin tight like i expected, however it still works because it does fit me around my chest comfortably and when worn under something it gives a nice blouson effect. also, the v is a very nice depth- not too deep or too shallow. overall, i'm happy with it because it's a n",4,05/11/2018
My favorite invisible socks,"I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!",5,12/11/2018
Great as a nightgown,"So i can see why this might not be an amazing shirt, it runs a little large imo and its long. i'm 5'5"" and its almost to my knees, but......as a nightgown, it's amazing! super comfy and its now my new favorite pajama dress. lol. i might wear it as a shirt too, but most likely just jammies!",4,19/08/2018
Kind of blah,"Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out, and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah",3,10/05/2018
Shimmer v,"Love this, but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic, the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it",3,08/08/2018
So soft,"I love this robe, it is my new favorite for lounging around the house",5,08/12/2018
Blissfully soft,"This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.",5,13/03/2018
So very odd,"The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.",1,24/06/2018
Gorgeous!,"This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs, bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!",5,22/08/2018
Lingerie?,"Fabulous fabric, adorable details. fitting is very, very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose, but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over, the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size, but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall,",3,21/03/2018
Beautiful,"I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.",5,05/06/2018
Terrible buy,I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,1,30/11/2018
Like wearing a hug,"This wrap is awesome. soft material, perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!), and warm, great for layering.",5,12/04/2018
So comfortable,"I love this jacket. it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable, and it's great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold, lazy days. it's not the world's most flattering fit (it's kind of boxy) but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted.",5,06/12/2018
"Great swimsuit, but only if you have a small bust.","I loved the swimsuit when i saw it online and it looks just a cool in person. however, i had to return it because the size large top was very very small. i wear a 34d bra. this top seemed like it would only work for an a or b cup size, even in the size large. cute suit for the right body, though!",4,06/09/2018
Love the design,"Love the design of these pants and they are super comfortable. perfect for running errands but managing not to look like you just rolled out of bed. bought the regular m size (usually i want petite because i'm 5'1"") and while they are a little long they still fit relatively well",4,05/12/2018
Love these leggings!,"I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.",5,08/09/2018
Very cute,"These pants are great, super cute and comfy. the price is too high but i do love them.",4,08/07/2018
Original workout leggings,"These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made, and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate, and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!",5,19/07/2018
Statement leggings,"I am in love with theses! they are incredibly comfortable and flattering. i have an hourglass figure, and they hug my hips perfectly. they perfect for the gym, but also look great with a tunic and booties for fun weekend wear. good + pure are my new go to legging brand. i'm going to order the solid black and other patterns retailer has.",5,30/01/2018
Pretty print!,Adorable print! just picked these up in the store yesterday! the print is so pretty and it caught my eye! surprisingly they fit in my usual size for workout pants!,5,23/07/2018
Leggings,"These are very well constructed, medium weight, besutiful leggings.",3,25/01/2018
Worth the wait!,"I first saw these in store, but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be!",5,25/08/2018
Feminine & perfect for spring,"My favorite leggings. they are feminine and perfect with a long tee. the colors are vibrant, the material is high quality, plus they're comfy! i ordered an xs. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs.",5,09/09/2018
Great fit,"The colors on these leggings are very nice and the fit was fabulous. the waist is high enough to hold in a slight ""muffin"" top and the control in the fabric is just right. i received several compliments on them and hubby really liked them.",5,08/05/2018
Just what i wanted,"These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright, cheery, and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2, so i ordered the xs, and they are just right.",5,19/11/2018
Don't bend over,Totally see through.,1,25/05/2018
Nice and neutral enough,"I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can't really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou",4,04/12/2018
Nice print and flattering,"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.",5,22/07/2018
Super cute and comfy,These super cute leggings are comfortable and functional with a fun design!,5,05/03/2018
Great pants - but damaged,"Love these pants -- the colors, style, fit. however, this is the second pair of retailer active pants i've ordered that i've discovered had a hole in them. these are not cheap pants, so the poor quality is inexcusable.",4,10/02/2018
Floreale leggings,"Really stretchy and therefore not a whole lot of compression. love the floral pattern and the color, but they're also surprisingly thin. they'll be good for yoga in the summer months, but i find them to be too thin to wear outside of the gym and i like a legging i can feel comfortable in running errands to and from the gym too. fit true to size.",4,01/09/2018
Would be really cute on a tall girl,"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute, however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also, for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back.",3,18/11/2018
Didn't work for me...,"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly, i returned it.",2,07/11/2018
This is a gorgeous swimsuit,"The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than on-line. i am 5'4"" and between 138/140 and ordered a medium. the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support. i am a 36c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support. the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support. the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps, it do",5,10/03/2018
"Flattering, but small","The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6"", 150 lbs, and usually a solid ""medium"" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place), but since it is a one piece, pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large.",5,15/02/2018
Mixed review,"I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great, but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look, but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable, the navy color is really pretty.",3,23/07/2018
Love these!,"I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.",5,24/03/2018
Great shorts,"Very happy with the fit, sizing, and look of these shorts.",4,04/06/2018
Fave shorts,"I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.",5,29/01/2018
Best shorts!,"I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the ""red"" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!",5,06/02/2018
Love these shorts,I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul,5,04/05/2018
Love. love. love.,"These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.",5,01/03/2018
Different colors are sized differently,"I tried these shorts on in 5 colors and found a wide variety of sizing. in the dark grey and taupe i needed to size down one from my usual 28 to a size 27. in the sapphire, lavender and red my regular size 28 fit perfectly. i ended up purchasing the dark grey and lavender with a discount. i gave 4 stars for the variation in sizing but once i got the correct fit the shorts have not stretched out on me throughout the day in either color. the length is perfect, short enough to not look frumpy, but",4,20/06/2018
Comfy and ok for muscular thighs,"I never buy shorter shorts, my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering, but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model, but hit a nice spot on the leg, and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs, all legs...",4,31/05/2018
Love these but color faded when washed,"I'm pretty disappointed in these. just bought the yellow pair and wore today for the first time. super cute and very comfortable. i was in love with them. they got two small stains on them from the day's activities ( and not even crazy, untreatable stains). unfortunately, the stains did not budge yet the color of the shorts washed out. they are completely ruined after one washing (on cold). i'm hoping this was a fluke and plan to order a second pair before they sell out. these will be going back",3,28/04/2018
New favorite shorts!,"I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.",5,05/05/2018
Great casual short,These shorts are age-appropriate for all. they're loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee. the fabric is soft and colors are fun,5,23/07/2018
Summer staple,"Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!",5,04/03/2018
Color run,"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",1,24/01/2018
Love these shorts!!,These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!,5,01/08/2018
Comfy and cute,"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.",5,08/05/2018
Please bring back the grey/gray!,"I listened to the other reviewers and ordered down...silly of me! all plcro seem to run a bit large and do stretch out. i got the 25 in the lovely light grey...fit me, but too tight to be comfy. i usually wear a 25,26, or 27 in jeans depending on the style. unfortunately, there are now no more in the grey...too bad. this shouldn't happen at the beginning of the season....please please please bring them back in this great neutral color or a stone.....",4,11/09/2018
Do not buy it!!!,"This pants the worst short that i ever had!!
i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!
i was really shock definetly will return it to store.
fyi, i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.",1,31/01/2018
I love these shorts!,"So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom",5,20/03/2018
"Comfy, summery",I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,5,19/06/2018
Wow,"I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home",5,12/05/2018
Something about these shorts!,I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????,5,23/11/2018
Great fitting for women with curves,I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.,5,31/08/2018
Love pilcro!,"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about",5,18/09/2018
Love and disappointment!,"These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly, using free and clear detergent on a cold, delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy, and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair, but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go, but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!",2,27/05/2018
Great shorts!!!!,"I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too.",5,20/05/2018
Go to shorts!,These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .,5,29/07/2018
Perfect shorts,I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.,5,28/05/2018
Best shorts around in years!,"Wonderful flattering fit, mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection. i bought 3 pair. thrilled with pilcro. 
only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa.  cuffs roll down if you want less sun.",5,10/08/2018
Love these shorts!,"I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year, these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!",5,08/10/2018
Favorite shorts ever,If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.,5,17/05/2018
Just what i needed in a summer short,"I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear",5,21/05/2018
Perfect,"These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise, they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.",4,18/08/2018
Love this top-deep v though,"I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.",5,17/08/2018
Very flattering shirt,"I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris.",5,22/06/2018
Wowser,"Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.
fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom.",5,13/04/2018
Nothing special,"It's so hard to tell exactly what this sweatshirt looks like from the online photos. it has a white and pale sky blue tie dye look all over with a sea foam green floral print. runs tts. the floral print isn't centered on the one i received, but for $11 i'll be keeping it.",4,22/11/2018
New fav spring top,"I picked this up on sale and was glad i did - the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast. the fit is right on, but size up if you are unsure or inbetween. the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt. the fit is boxy - but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design.",5,27/10/2018
Unique take on sweatshirt,I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.,3,04/02/2018
Cute and warm,Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.,5,30/11/2018
Beautiful and comfortable!,"There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!",5,01/11/2018
Oh-my-gosh,"The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the",5,12/07/2018
Yes yes yes!,"I'm always looking for easy casual items that will withstand being washed a million times, and i think this one will fall into that category. it's a nice thick knit - durable yet soft and sooo cozy. length is fantastic for leggings. i'll basically live in this on weekends!",5,22/01/2018
Warm and comfortable,"Although true to size, i sized up to improve pocket placement and for a longer and slouchier fit like on the model. the pockets in my regular size were almost too high up and made my midsection look bunchy.",4,17/09/2018
"Great top, but adds volume to the midsection","I loved this top on the mannequin, so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10, i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..",5,24/03/2018
Great fall sweater,I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.,5,21/11/2018
New favorite sweater,"Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it's a nice surprise.",5,27/02/2018
Would it be wrong for me to just live in this?,"This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes, or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #2 is shown: meaning, folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown, tan, or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch.

my only ""criticism"" is this is a dolman-style/drop hem sleeve, which i am not a huge fan of - bu",5,03/04/2018
Love the texture and color,"Love the texture and color of this tunic. it does seem to run large - i could have probably sized down to a pl without an issue. i do agree with other reviewers that the pockets are strangely placed and add bulk. i'm going to have them removed. overall, i really like it and have already worn it multiple times.",4,29/06/2018
Stylish tunic,"This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4, 116 lbs., size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down, without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty, the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi",5,23/03/2018
Super cute and comfortable.,Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!,5,03/11/2018
Beautiful print and well made,I love this design so much and it is very well made. i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups. i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit. only con is that it seems to run small.,5,03/12/2018
Super cute,Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!,5,17/02/2018
Maaji bottoms,"Love these bottoms, cheekier than i thought but like them even more!",5,21/08/2018
Make your buns look adorable,"Love this brand and i keep coming back. i don't have the most tone tush, but maaji always gives a cute little lift. i order a size up (usually a small so i order a medium).",5,21/05/2018
Unique detailing / boho,"Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless.",5,20/04/2018
Maaji patchwork top,"I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive, which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups, adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.",5,05/05/2018
Great jammies,"These pants fit great, are soft, comfy, and flattering. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect in a medium. they wash well.",5,11/07/2018
Super comfy,"These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10"" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!",5,22/09/2018
Comfortable and flattering,"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is",5,05/10/2018
Tall girls,"The length of these pants is not quite long enough. i'm 5'8, and the only way i can make these work is if they're pulled low on the hips. it'd be nice if more brands offered long and short sizes in lounge",4,12/04/2018
Beautiful pants,"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me.",5,01/04/2018
Long sleeve version of the tanks,"I was really excited that they decided to make these. i am a big fan of the tanks and wanted a long sleeve (or even short sleeve - hint!) version of them to wear under suits to work in the winter etc. these do the job nicely - bought ivory and black. other reviewer is right however, something strange in the shoulders as they are quite narrow and the fabric tends to bunch a bit and the arm length is a little strange. i am 5'8 and 150 lbs and order a medium in most retailer stuff and i tend to buy a",4,24/05/2018
Runs very small,"I nearly always wear a size small, and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this, and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.",3,15/03/2018
Just a layering piece for me,"Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.",2,04/10/2018
Sparkles!,"I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh",5,17/02/2018
Great piece for petites,"Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.",5,22/08/2018
Sparkly!,"I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!",5,15/04/2018
Love these!,My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.,5,24/03/2018
Surprise!,"I love clothing that has little surprises, and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is",5,13/08/2018
Flimsy,"Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!",2,02/11/2018
Great lightweight henley,"Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that's what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.",5,06/06/2018
Beautiful twist on a classic,"I found this top to be very beautiful and well made.
the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus.
it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top.
and going towards spring it extends wearing time.
the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater.
it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities.
i found it runs very true to size.
i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t",5,12/06/2018
Sweet top,I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.,5,28/01/2018
Cute casual shorts,"I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from",5,31/05/2018
Nice detailing,"I tried this on in gray while in store, it was the cuff detailing that initially attracted me. once i tried it on there wasn't a lot i loved about it so it didn't leave with me but now that it's on sale, it's the perfect choice. i'm wearing a medium in the photo, and the only real downfall is how long the arms are on me and i have long arms. maybe sizing down would help but i fear i have too much winter weight to hide to take a small. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 145 lbs curvy hourglass, generous hi",4,06/10/2018
Love it!,"I wasn't sure how this would look on, but it is very flattering. looks great with leggings or jeans! i have received many complements!",4,14/08/2018
"Soft, stylish tunic",This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!,5,25/05/2018
Perfect!,This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.,5,25/04/2018
Comfy,The lengths is what drew me to this top. i love the simple look of the cowl neck. nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look.,4,21/10/2018
Love the sleeves,"I am usually a medium, but sized down to a small for a more fitted look. the light pink is slightly sheer, but will look great over leggings and jeans. i love the detail on the sleeve.",5,22/04/2018
Flattering and elegant,"Like many clothes, this looks much better on you than on the model; with a little bit of curve, it is not shapeless but very flattering. i wore it out with friends for drinks and they all exclaimed at how elegant it was. the wrist keyhole is a nice touch, and quality is very good. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs.",5,20/06/2018
Purchased...thought about it...and returned,"I purchased this, and it ended up sitting in my closet for a couple of weeks. i bought it in the green, and i felt it did nothing to enhance my figure. it's kind of a boring design. i like the cowl neck (rare on a tunic) and the sleeve details. the colors don't seem to go well with standard black leggings. overall, unimpressed.",3,06/02/2018
Buy it!!,"This is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size, simple yet flattering lines, very comfortable. it has such flattering little touches as well, such as the detail work on the sleeves. love it, love it, love it! i just wish it were machine washable!!",5,07/05/2018
Very stylish tunic-top!,"I love this top! from the details on the cuffs to the draping at the neck to the light-weight, yet very high-quality material, this top is my new winter-spring transition piece. i'm 5'3"", small chest, and a slight curve in the hips. the arms of this top fit me fine, but because the fabric doesn't stretch, you may find the sleeves too fitted. the length is perfect for hiding the butt without looking like pajamas (about mid-thigh). i've paired it with cuffed jeans and sneakers (like the model is w",5,22/05/2018
Comfy & stylish,"Long, thin, tunic.  perfect over leggings, great for casual day but look pulled together.",5,27/05/2018
"Comfy, long jersey tunic","I love most pure and good clothing pieces, mostly because the fit and fabric are comfy and made of good quality materials. this tunic does deliver on both counts, but i is very, very long and straight up and down.
fyi: i have a boyish figure, having no waist/hips. i have a broad shoulder/back, so the cowl neckline coupled with the very long and straight tunic doesn't really flatter my body. it would be okay for just haging around the house, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this tunic out",4,30/01/2018
Amazing swimsuit,"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!  

this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.   

the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.",5,02/11/2018
"Good, not great...","I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available, and lets say i was swimming in the xl, much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two, the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl, seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well, however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely, the suit has boning on the side of the bust, and also the silicone grip on the top edge,",3,05/11/2018
Love this but wish a few things were different...,"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else",5,30/04/2018
Love it!!,"This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.",5,16/02/2018
Cute top,This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.,5,04/07/2018
A great wake up call,This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!,5,21/05/2018
Perfect,"Soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm. flattering cut. quality material and construction. fully opaque, so no show-though. true to size (i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, my usual size small is perfect). could not improve upon these joggers. love, love, love.",5,15/09/2018
Very small,"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.",2,24/03/2018
"So cute, petite fits great","I think this romper is super stylish, kind of dvf-ish and it's as-pictured except it's more colorful in person; the vines are pink and pale aqua, and the flowers are deeper yellows with white & beige parts and pink dots in them. i see what other reviewers mean that the fabric is thin, it is, but i wouldn't say sheer. it's a lightweight woven fabric. the problem is there's no stretch, so when you reach up, the whole romper hikes up. i think it's true-to-size. i got my usual xspetite and it fits g",5,16/05/2018
"Cheap, thin fabric. too bad.",Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,1,28/05/2018
It's okay,"I've noticed this sports bra several times in my store-along with a whole line of products that share this fabric and didn't feel necessarily compelled to try it on but i finally did this last time at retailer. i pretty much predicted what i was going to think of it. i like the back with the extra strappy open section, but that is where it ends. the fabric is not particularly flattering, and i didn't think the bra accentuated my chest. i do have a small bust size, but i have a lot of sports",3,08/06/2018
Nice and soft fabric,"I tried this on, the fit was true to size, as far as no cup size goes (32dd, got xs, was ok). the pattern i like, and was totally fine on my pale skin, but think of it, i would not likely wear this without a tank or shirt... support seemed ok too, i do like the criss-cross detail in the abck. thinking about keeping it, but i jsut don't ""need"" it right this second... dilemma.

caveat: not been tested in a workout, obviously, since i am not sure i will keep it (may chance it on sale).",4,06/05/2018
Love the floral pattern,"I love this sports bra. i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running. the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this, but the quality of this bra is the best i've ever gotten. i wear a 34b bra and the medium fits perfect!!",5,03/06/2018
"Great fit, comfortable, flashy","I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!",5,11/03/2018
Great strappy back,"I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high",5,06/12/2018
Great!,"I bought these leggings for yoga. i love them. the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus. the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings. the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice! for reference, i am 5'4, 130 lbs and i purchased a m. fit was great. i normally wear size 27-28 in pants. would recommend.",5,05/12/2018
Like velvet!,"These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.",5,01/07/2018
"Nice staple, thin, long",Was looking for a layering tunic and this does the job. it's very long and i'm 5'11 and this covers to my mid thigh. the arms are very tight but stretched after a while and the material is thin. i like the button details and the olive color are a nice break from black and white. white might be see-through.,4,30/05/2018
Lovely but odd sizing,"I received this top and loved the pattern. however, i ordered both and s and m, and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c, and the bust area was way too big on both, but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau, so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern, so if you're going to give it a try orde",3,04/07/2018
Nice fit -- but colors vary!,"I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to",5,26/08/2018
"Fun, unique romper","I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist.",5,23/11/2018
Love it!,"This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.",5,10/08/2018
Didn't work for me,"I was excited to get this romper, but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.",2,02/04/2018
Unfortunate!!,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,3,02/12/2018
Substantial material,"Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy.",5,06/03/2018
Bigger than my first apartment,"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally, i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper, given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly, the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",1,13/09/2018
Perfect fit,I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!,5,13/02/2018
"Love, love, love","I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.

Perfect!,"After having my third child, i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy. i've always loved the comfort of a romper, but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me. this romper does not disappoint. it hides areas i want hidden, but does so with style. i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this. i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece!",5,29/06/2018
Recommend with reservations,"This jumpsuit is all the things other reviewers have stated: roomy, flattering, has give. however, note: the way in and out of this outfit is a single button with a loop at the top of the back. if you need to run to the restroom - plan. it can be an absolute pain to get out of this outfit to go to the restroom. let's not talk about the possibilities of the outfit dropping on a public restroom floor...yes, i went there...

Adorable!,"Fell in love with this romper online, but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large, i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering, delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium, but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.",5,29/05/2018
Nice!,"I threw this into my cart online on a whim, but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference, i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2, and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side, i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size, as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me, and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't",4,12/08/2018
Unexpected find,"I was at my local retailer this weekend, needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the ""get it while it lasts"" section, in my size. i tried it on (top in two different sizes 32c and 34b and a bottom), and it was literally the only time in my life i've ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results! great material, the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric, supportive top without squishing (went with the 32c...same as my regular bras), t",5,11/06/2018
Top portion too low,This was such a cute suit but strange how they designed it. top runs super low and it almost did not cover my breast area. runs small. i had to return because fit was way to small for a large suit.,4,24/02/2018
Super cute suit for slim girls,"I love this suit. it is a really cute color way & stripe and the fabric is nice, but... i ordered an xl. i have 20-30 extra pounds on me leftover from my last child. i am currently wearing a 10 or a 12. this suit would be great for a thinner girl, but i could not wear this suit to the family pool. the bottom is cut kind of skimpy and the breast area does not have much support. this xl would be a better fit on an 8-10. it will need to go back.",4,27/11/2018
"Cute pattern, but i don't live this shirt","This shirt is cute, nice cut, but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.",3,16/11/2018
Definitely not just a sleep top!,"I would not wear this to bed - it's almost too pretty! i've been wearing this top under sweaters and shells as the weather is moving from winter to spring - i think it transitions the comfort of plaid into warmer weather perfectly! it dips a little low on me in the front (34b/c), so it's probably not for more professional settings. i like to wear it with a lacy bra-type top peeking out underneath.",4,02/08/2018
Love it!!,"This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca",5,10/05/2018
Not true to size,"These run really small..almost 2 sizes up. so if you order these, i would order a few sizes to cover your basis. otherwise, good quality, good coverage. hopefully sizing up will fit me.",4,30/08/2018
Definitely runs small,I bought the blue and it is beautiful. it definitely runs small and i agree with the other reviewer who stated to order 2 sizes up.,5,30/11/2018

Summer staple,"These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!",5,21/06/2018

"Notfor ""squat"" thighs","I love these shorts, very pretty and well made, but if you have any kind of muscle in your thighs, beware, not as flattering as on the model a9dn probably previous reviewer). shorts hit at hte widest part of my leg, creating a weird tent effect around the area. waist was true to sizw and i can only imagine how beautiful they would be on ""skinny"" legs.",3,02/09/2018
Phenomenal find!,I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned. they are the perfect length. they are very well made. i have worn them to my son's baseball game and the sec tournament. they are tailored and have an interesting design. they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds. i am thrilled with them.,5,08/07/2018
Not for d cup,"I knew going in that it may not fit a d cup but the fabric is beautiful so i thought i'd give it a try. i wear a 36d and bought a large. it's got a clasp in the back so there's no adjustment on how it fits around which for me was too big. the triangles did not provide enough coverage, left too much side boob. the fabric was very pretty in person but thinner than i expected which also made it seem less sturdy. sadly, have to return and cancel the back-ordered bottoms. i would recommend to someone",4,19/09/2018
Gorgeous prints! not a great fit for everyone.,"I ordered the romantic floral in s and xs to try on at home and just love the print! the fabric is so pretty and unique! others have mentioned how ""thin"" the fabric was but i thought it was pretty standard for a bikini/swimwear and had no complaints myself. there are removable cup liners so nothing can really show through the top. the sizing was tts and the xs fit me best. unfortunately this bikini will be returned because the fit is a little off. i love the thicker strap at the bottom of the ha",3,01/03/2018
Not good for girls with a big chest,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak,2,03/04/2018
So super soft!,This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.,5,14/10/2018
Comfy and adorable!,"I ordered this in xs, i'm 5'4"", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i'd buy more!",5,16/08/2018
"Versatile top, super comfortable","This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties, or it can be worn w/ leggings, jeans and tennis shoes, etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi",5,22/07/2018
Boxy and unflattering,"Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft, the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy, which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.",3,28/03/2018
Cute and well made,This is very practical. it goes with many things and is very comfortable....it can be worn with different leggings or with jeans! and it is well made! thanks retailer!,5,16/07/2018
Love these!!,"I was hesitant to order these especially because they didn't have a petite since there's shipping and i thought i might have to return them. i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big (i'm usually a 4 but in retailer bottoms 0-2). i ordered the 2 regular since there were no petites. they're not too high waisted (i think they could have gone higher) but they're not low, either. love them. they're so fun and i can't wait to break them out.",5,04/02/2018
Fabulous print!,Love these shorts. such a pretty print!,5,27/03/2018
Adore the fabric,"The fabric design of these shorts is so great. i don't adore the fit, they are a little short waisted for my long torso and the leg openings flare out more than i prefer and are about 1/2-1 inch longer than i would like but i can fix the inseam issue by hemming them. i may still pick them up just because i love the fabric so much.",4,29/01/2018
Love these shorts!,"Hi quality fabric and detail. fit really well. i'm 5.4, 120 and they will be a staple of my summer wardrobe.",5,24/01/2018
Not last year's cut,"I had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person. unfortunately, the cut is different. the sides, covered here by the model's hands, flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates. the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year. i don't own anything else high-wasted, being an apple i'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt",3,14/03/2018
Perfection,"I love these shorts. love that the inseam is longer than 3"". the pattern is awesome, perfect for spring. my thighs are always going to be bigger than most, so i sized up 1 size like i do in all cartonnier pants. these are a must have for spring/summer!",5,22/01/2018
Springtime!,"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile.",5,19/07/2018
Love it,I love this short. i normally wear size 10 this short just bit larger than average 10 .it is not to short not to long just perfect.,5,25/08/2018
Beautiful fit and design.,"These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!",5,19/05/2018
Pretty cute shorts,I tried these on in a 6 which is my usual size in bottoms that are not designer jeans and they fit ok. they were a little short waisted but i have a long torso. sizing up to an 8 helped but then they were fairly wide in the legs. they are meant to flare out a bit i believe but it was too much for me. i like them but i don't love.,4,31/03/2018
"Love, love, love!","This was my first time to try this brand and they fit so well and are super comfortable. i love the pockets also. i am 5'1, 108 and i got a 2p and they fit just right.",4,23/03/2018
L space ruched maillot,"I love the color and design of this suit, however, the rise is too high on my derriã¨re and was not appealing on myself! i am 5'7"" 110 lbs., with a very small bust and a short waist. i think the suit runs very small, as i am a size xs/s in most of retailers clothing. i would recommend it to young lady with a very small derriere and is more petite!",3,24/10/2018
Love this suit!,"I was looking for a basic black one piece suit that sucked in the tummy, but with style and a little flair. this is it! the ruching is perfect, the material is great and the separation of the straps at the top give it more style. i am usually a size 6, but ordered an 8 because i have a 34d chest. i was right on. the 8 covers the top with a small amount of cleavage and the bottom still fits because the ruching is a little tighter in the waist. i plan to wear this to the local pools this summer an",5,26/03/2018
Amazing pair of leggings!,The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional. the pattern/coloring is even more beautiful in person. overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in.,5,31/10/2018
Wearable art,"Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare.",5,11/06/2018
Amazing fabric,I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!,5,30/08/2018
Great leggings!,"These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly, as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.",5,13/06/2018
Classy leggings,"These are very cool leggings. the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging. they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit. i wore them for the first time today and really loved them. i didn't feel like i was out in ""leggings"" but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants. the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over - including the rear. they are definitely sculpting and firming. they fit the same size-wise as",5,08/06/2018
From work-out to errands,"I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.",5,14/11/2018
Love,"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear.",5,18/10/2018
Very flattering!,"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down. 
as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one",5,23/04/2018
The perfect gym pant,"I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!",5,17/09/2018
Lightweight and holds their shape,"Got these shorts in both colors: the blue-gray and the red-pink. super lightweight in hot humd weather, and keeps a crisp shape (doesn't get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do). really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depth.
.
if you're between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day. i got these in a size 2 and they get a little loose on my 33""-25""-37ish"" frame. i'm 5'2"" and the petite was sold out, so i don't know if t",5,05/11/2018
This one doesn't work with full hips,"Beautiful shorts, good length but if you have lots of lower body curves- probably not for you!",4,17/03/2018
Feels oh sooo good!,"Never want to take this tee off, so comfy, & neutral, ecru stripe, with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb! goes with a ton of items from my own closets! need more in every color/print/stripe......just feels ooh, soooo good",5,30/10/2018
Love it!,"I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors, but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out, but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.",5,27/11/2018
Sleek and fun,Very nice long-sleeved shirt. the fabric is soft and warm. you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket.,5,13/04/2018
Pills,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.,3,25/11/2018
Very fun!,"Great colors! somewhat odd fit but it works. don't love the bell on the tassel so i need to find some way to get that off, but otherwise i love it and i am definitely keeping!",4,08/06/2018
Adjustable and stylish,The adjustable tie is really nice and adds a nice style twist to a black suit.,4,18/07/2018
Beautiful color,I purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top. the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute. unfortunately it made my chest look too big... but the quality is really nice and i'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types.,4,09/05/2018
Worth the splurge,"This is different from any bra i've had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one.",5,11/07/2018
Cute but not practical,Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.,1,22/01/2018
Petal soft and pretty.,"This is a very comfortable bralette- the silk covers one's most sensitive parts, so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing. it's very pretty, too. i wear a 34b bra and the small fits me. it doesn't have a lot of support, but it's very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands. the cups are a little far apart, but it still works. if you're looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear, i would recommend this at the sale price.",5,25/10/2018
Worked for me!,"I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall, 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.",4,19/03/2018
Nice bermuda shorts,"I thought these were very nice bermuda shorts. i have skinnier legs and i didn't see a problem with them being too baggy there. the olive color was nice, very comfortable material.",4,11/09/2018
"Runs large, not the most flattering fit","I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are 1) older and don't want to show off that much leg anymore, and 2) are ""curvy on the bottom"" and really cannot wear the shorter shorts. i ordered these immediately in the navy. i usually wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, and like the other reviewer observed as well, i was floating in these - not only in the waist but everywhere. the legs are big - but it's supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that, but they just are",2,05/07/2018
"Not good if you sweat ""down there""","I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area, then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.",3,20/04/2018
Just as soft and stylish as the pants,"I was very happy to see these longer length shorts (i have 2 pair of the shorter ones and loved them last summer) so i ordered them immediately. i am curvy and wear a 29 in pilcro and ordered the navy, which is a lovely color and will go with everything. i think they fit great and i like the fact that they are a looser style. i will buy more when they go on sale.",4,13/05/2018
Man shorts,"I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.",1,14/09/2018
Amazing,Hands down most comfortable bra ever!,5,12/05/2018
Stays put,Classic design with nice details. stays in place for those active bikini wearers.,4,10/08/2018
So cute in person!,"The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!",5,06/03/2018
Super comfortable,I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.,5,04/03/2018
Love this skort!,I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.,5,10/06/2018
A piece that stands out,"I like the idea of a skort, and how it is different than everything else out there. this skort is a bit dressy--perfect for a summer party or drinks on the patio at a city cafe. i love that it has pockets. the fabrics used in the patchwork are quality and the tailoring is nice. it fit me true to size. i can't wait for warmer weather to wear it!",4,04/03/2018
Adorable and hard working piece!,"I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!",5,14/11/2018
So cute n comfy,Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-),5,25/04/2018
"Really, really cute","I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#.",5,20/02/2018
Good support,"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.",5,31/05/2018
This is the perfect throw on shirt.,I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.,5,24/08/2018
Hidden treasure,"This vest is awesome - the photo does not do it justice. you can dress it up or dress it down. great materials used. does run big, so select one size down!",5,01/06/2018
Way better in person,This is a must have! way cuter in person. love the look and feel. it runs large so size down. it's more cream than white,5,03/09/2018
On the fence,"I adore a good vest, so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often, but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it, took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl, and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line, and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin, or even w",3,10/11/2018
Beautiful,"Very unique, beautiful piece.  drapes well, accentuates curves in a classy way.  this is an eye catcher.  definitely.",5,25/10/2018
Cannot get enough of this!,"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!",5,22/06/2018
Sexy and comfortable,"Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink, size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly, i could even probably go to an xs, but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.",5,14/03/2018
Cute & comfy,"Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you'd find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i'm normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it.",5,22/05/2018
Immediate favorite/ instant staple,"I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first, i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on, it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch, but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors, i'd buy them all lol.",5,12/09/2018
So disappointed,I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,1,05/10/2018

Love!,"Thick, soft, awesome quality - what's not to love?! i've had an awful time finding a new black warm cardigan this year to throw over anything from a tee to a casual dress, and this finally fits the bill! while it is soft like a sweatshirt, i would definitely not say that this is purely loungewear. nice enough to replace my old ratty sweaterknit!",5,01/03/2018
Too much cardigan,"I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home, i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck, and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t",2,12/05/2018
Cozy but bulky,"This has a lot of extra fabric in the chest area. i was hoping i could button and close that in a way that didn't just have it jutting out. luckily, it's still flattering. definitely bulky. and in the black, it's picking up lots of dust and lint. still a great cut and look, so i'm happy with it overall.",4,07/05/2018
Sfylish and versatile,"Great ""sweater/jacket for spring and fall! i am a pilates tea her and great for before and after workouts! great price and a little thicker material like a sweatshirt to keep you nice and warm. tried it in-store and bought on online ! love",4,11/03/2018
"Beautiful cardigan, poorly designed...","I wish i could wax poetic about this gorgeous cardigan. i would have happily bought it in both colors except for the deal-breaking design flaw - the extremely tight sleeves. even if you have stick-thin arms, i don't know how you would ever be able to wear anything other than a tank top under it. sadly for me, this was a no go :(",3,02/07/2018
Cozy comfy,"Great cardigan that can be put over everything! cute with yoga pants, jeans, or something dressier.",4,15/11/2018
Warm and cozy,"Saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming plane ride. originally ordered the teal color, but when it arrived, i was disappointed that it was more of a muddy greenish teal and not the light bluish teal like in the photo. exchanged it for the black version and i couldn't be happier. the black goes well with everything--looks great with jeans and yoga pants. love it!!",5,24/02/2018
Love this!!,Very comfy and warm! i love this! i bought the xs even though i am usually a s or xs.,5,23/08/2018
Too much material,"Beautiful color and softness, very warm, but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.",3,19/09/2018
"So cute, but blue?","Interestingly, the description said this was blue, but as it looks on the picture, it is more grey. that being said, about the zippie: love. my stylist (i brought it in for a try on session at my local store), said, ""you know how i feel about sweats, i won't like it""... joke on her, she turned around and was ok, i shouldn't have looked, love the ruffles at the bottom...it makes this ""sweater"" much more special. it is actually really cute for casual day, jeans t-shirt, kids... or over sweats. any",5,24/03/2018
Casual beauty!,"This sweater jacket is perfect.
it is gorgeous, casual, unique and a closet must have!

Weekend top,"I love this top. it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend. i am curvy, and the drape of the top works well on my frame. i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown, but i like the top too much to get sweat on it :)",5,28/04/2018
Snow day loungers,"So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise, excellent.",5,09/05/2018
Soft and comfortable,"I've been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.)",4,21/05/2018
Itchy tags,"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",1,26/09/2018
Not comfortable because of itchy tags,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,1,24/07/2018
Great,"Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg, have plenty of length (i'm 5'6, and there is a good inch of extra length), but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though, but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey, probably a size 31 in jeans right now, and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality",5,10/07/2018
Great wide leg sweatpants!,Retailerpologists has always carried the best sweatpants. i wish they sold these in more colors. very flattering!,5,12/06/2018
Disappointed,"Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.",1,07/02/2018
The perfect bra,"Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.",5,18/06/2018
A zip-up jacket with a little extra style,"Like the other reviewer mentioned, this jacket has a very trim fit, so size up if you want any extra wiggle room or are not a fan of snug clothing. i liked the warm neutral color and the gathered ruched detail up the front. ultimately i did not buy it due to the sleeves being a bit long and the style more body-hugging than what i was looking for. but it is comfortable and a nice twist on a classic.",4,11/09/2018
Size up,"I love the ruching on this hoodie, which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small, 34b, 130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).",5,29/09/2018
So cute and comfortable,This fabric feels a little bit like heaven. i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies. it's adorable and the fabric is so soft. i think i'm in love. i'm 5'2 95 lbs. xxsmall was a perfect fit.,5,15/02/2018
"Soft, body conforming and comfy!","First i must say that i bought this zip up hoodie because of the material and how incredibly soft and comfortable it was - absolutely worth the price. however, the sleeves were about 4"" too long! because i am a seamstress, and this was an easy hem for me i went ahead and purchased it and hemmed up the sleeves, but i was honestly shocked how long they were. you would have to have very long arms for this to fit you without alterations. if you don't mind rolling them up i suppose it might work as w",4,08/11/2018
Puts me right in the mood for spring!,"The peach color is beautiful on this jacket, and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.",5,21/03/2018
Wardrobe staple for me!,"Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on",5,24/02/2018
Not true to size,I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.,3,04/12/2018
Runs two sizes too small,"Wow. had to check label to see if a m was shipped by accident.

nice details. 

too bad!",4,13/10/2018
Cute jacket.,Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.,5,01/03/2018
Sizing inconsistency in coral but love,"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals, one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly, a looser jacket sti",5,14/06/2018
Purchased coral and cream,"I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me, more orange than a true coral. but for summer, is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small, my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral, i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little, but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee, with yoga pants,",5,03/04/2018
Nice lightweight jacket,"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

jacket fits well and is not too heavy. didn't feel tight in the arms. great to wear on a cool spring day! i bought the white and grey jacket.",5,10/03/2018
Versatile jacket,"This caught my eye in the store last week, and i decided to try it on. it's the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear, but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it's very flattering and i found it to run true to size.",5,30/08/2018
Awesome!,I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.,5,17/02/2018
Ended up with all 3,"I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute, flattering, so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced",5,24/02/2018
Love the coral color,"I'm 5'5 130 lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite. i like the petite better even though there isn't much of a difference, the petite is about 28 inches long. it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think it's too long for that. i love the beautiful coral color, received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it. the quality is superb. the only downside is i don't like the way it looks when zipped, it doesn't give mu",5,24/04/2018
Cute jacket,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,5,11/09/2018
Love it!,So pretty & comfortable! love it!,5,03/02/2018
Love it!,"Ordered online in white, just received it, love i! i wear m in most clothing, size 6 dress, jacket fits perfectly. would love one in the peach color shown in the pic but from the reviews stating it is much deeper in colour decided against it.",5,22/07/2018
Casual and slimming,"Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.",5,19/04/2018
Super soft,"Great, really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it's still a little big, but it works. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs.",5,03/09/2018
Beautiful for 1 day,"This hoodie is beautiful, soft and flattering. but the soft fabric pilled badly after one wearing and it's probably going to look ratty after a few washings. i might accept pilling in a $30 sweatshirt but not at this price. i don't really want to take it back but i will. (i've complained to retailer employees in the past about other clothes pilling and poor quality, and they've always said i could bring it back)",3,29/09/2018
Great basic tank,"Great basic tank with a bit of a 'flair' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white.",5,18/07/2018
Sturdy basic,"Got this in gray, pretty good quality, all around good basic.",4,27/07/2018
Perfect tank!,"I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!",5,09/06/2018
Pure perfection,This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,5,13/07/2018
See through and strange,"I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric, it is tacky!",1,09/09/2018
Comfy & cool,What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!,5,02/08/2018
Better than it looks!,"I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this",5,06/11/2018
Adorable suit,"I ordered this suit online which is something i never do!! i am 5'6"" 120# and ordered the 6. it fits perfectly! it covers up nicely. i am small chested (34a) and it has padded cups which enhances my chest. the ruching hides any tummy flaws. really a slimming suit and great quality.",5,12/04/2018
Perfect for post-baby,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body, i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places, and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl, so i wasn't sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom",5,03/05/2018
Love!!,"I love this swisuit. it is very well made and super flattering. i've received so many compliments on it. i have 3 little kids (4, 2.5, and 7 months) so it is perfect for chasing them around at the pool or beach. i am still working on losing the baby weight, so the rusching in front works well to hide my tummy. i am 5'2 and about 116lbs and the size 4 works well. i'm hoping it will go on sale so i can buy another one, but i imagine these will sell out quickly.",5,25/06/2018
Believe the hype!,"I have been wearing tankinis for a long time and haven't worn a one piece in years. i'm 40 and, let's be honest, things don't look the same in a bathing suit as they did 20 years ago. this suit is very flattering - i'm not obese, but i do have a bit of a jelly roll in the stomach area and the combination of the polka dots and the ruching, as well as the construction of the suit itself with the side panels, really camouflages my stomach area. although there isn't underwire, which i prefer, i do f",5,24/05/2018
Great fit--exactly as expected!,This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.,5,05/04/2018
Fits amazing,"This is the first one piece swimsuit i've owned since i was a toddler. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs 34b bust with short torso and athletic built legs...so i wasn't sure how this would fit. was i ever surprised!! i bought the size small in the mint chevron pattern. the material is substantial but not overly thick. it is double layered and the cups are padded for extra coverage. it was a little tight to pull on but after having it on it conformed to my curves like it was cut to fit them. the top offers an",5,27/10/2018
Very flattering and easy to wear,"Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well, definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!",5,07/04/2018
Had high hopes but pattern is sewn crooked,"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately, the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware.",2,13/02/2018
Chevron pattern off center in back,"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l",1,07/09/2018
Beware of the mint striped pattern,"I have this suit in the ""tile"" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the ""mint"" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the ""v"" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result, my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad, because the",3,14/07/2018
Most flattering suit i've ever seen,"I love this suit! the fit is incredible. 

i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time, but i got it on sale, and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!",5,10/07/2018
Lovely one piece,"This is a beautiful swim suit! the overall look is lovely; the ruffle is sweet and the low-cut front keeps it just the right amount of sexy for a one piece. i didn't keep it only because i would have preferred the leg opening to be cut a little higher. otherwise, it fit very well. i'm 5'10"" and 150, with broad shoulders and a substantial rack (nursing a baby right now) and i didn't have any problems with support. great buy!",4,17/08/2018
The 1 piece,"A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering, amazing quality, soft material, good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!",5,27/05/2018
Beautiful and flattering,"I ordered this in the china pattern color, and the colors are vibrant and beautiful! the suit is well made and slimming. there are no bra cups; just a shelf bra, but the tie halter adds some extra support. i have trouble buying bathing suits, but i am very happy with this one.",4,15/09/2018
Flattering suit!,I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed! i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent. i have a rather big chest (36dd) and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me. look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!,5,09/03/2018
Not for the busty babes!,"Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!",2,20/02/2018
Lovely little number,"Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi",5,30/06/2018
Ruffled halter maillot,Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.,5,01/03/2018
Breastfeeding friendly,"I'm on the smaller end of the bust spectrum even nursing i'm a 32c/d at my fullest. i adore this suit. there is zero support so if you need that move on don't buy this. i love it -hides the post partum baby puff, pattern detracts from flaws, deep plunge is modest yet still sexy and it's super stretchy and easily be pulled aside to feed a baby. underneath there's a fabric bra insert so if you bend over nothing can be seen which i like. haven't worn in water or waves yet but fabric feels awesome.",5,07/03/2018
Flattering and subtle,"This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even, and maybe especially, because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire, which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size, but might run a tad lar",5,24/04/2018
Beautiful suit,"I bought a suit similar to this last year, and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print, and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso, so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!",5,15/08/2018
Perfect!,"I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more",5,30/03/2018
Stunning!,"I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!",5,19/04/2018
Gorgeous bathing suit!,"Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.",5,13/08/2018
Perfect swimsuit,"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they don't get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i haven't worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte",5,16/08/2018
This bathing suit is a dream.,"Simply perfect. i ordered the white floral maillot in a large (5'6""-ish, 145 pounds) and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off. the colors are so vibrant and accurate, which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person. i do recommend ordering a size up -- the medium was snug, but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet. now that they have a new print -- hello fish!! -- i really really want another!",5,30/04/2018
Extremely pretty swimsuit,"Extremely pretty swimsuit, gorgeous cut in the front with the lace and the floral print, very flattering to hourglass shapes. coverage across rear end is a bit less than i would prefer, but it's so very pretty that i'm keeping it. several comments from friends that this could be worn as a tank top for regular wear it is so pretty.",4,29/08/2018
"Pretty pattern, lacking in support","I love the way that this suit looked, however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on, that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine, but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.",3,18/09/2018
Perfect suit,"I have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports, but doesn't look matronly. this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece, but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful. i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good and/or support a 34ff, but gave it try because of all the 5 star reviews. i tried it on and my husband just said ""wow!"" this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports - i don't know how, but it doe",5,15/07/2018
Really soft fabric,"The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute, however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.",3,28/02/2018
Better than the photos,"Ok, so first things first. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 4/27, 32g and i took a small in this. it's your typical cloth/stone fabric and feel sooo good!
i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that ""oversized"". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4"" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that ""long grandma butt"" that some rompers",5,31/10/2018
Do i dare??,Lovely! feels like you are wearing silk and hits for comfort in all the right places. still mulling whether the short length is appropriate and if my athletic/full lower body is complimented by this cutie...needed a second opinion to push me over the top and take this home as a summer staple,4,27/08/2018
Super short shorts...,"Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.",2,01/12/2018
Easy to dress up or dress down,"I absolutely love this romper. the chambray material is super comfy and easy to wear. i ordered a size up (l ), and i'm happy i did bc it would have been a little too tight in the arm area to squeeze into and gave a little extra wiggle room in the belly area. for reference i usually wear size 8/m and i'm a 34c",5,03/07/2018
Very nice,"I'm not sure what cup size i am, 36b or 36c, but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public, but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops, but the medium worked for those too.",5,26/02/2018
Soft!,"Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too ""mom"" like.",5,26/09/2018
"Pretty, but rides up","I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors, but after only a few minutes of wearing them, i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28, and ordered these in a m, but i guess they were still too small, which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty, but i will not be ordering more.",3,23/03/2018
Don't even know they are there!,"I bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy, but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday! it doesn't even feel like i am wearing anything. love these!",5,20/07/2018
Great! but delicate,"These are great, the colors are a little different in real life. they are really great but i think they are a bit delicate and i hope they hold up.",4,10/10/2018
White/palm color is slightly see-through,"The suit is beautiful, however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight, to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing, i ordered a medium, i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa",3,24/03/2018
"Beautiful fabric, no cup room","Got the coral reef color in a size medium. for reference, i say i am 5' 4"" because its easier than explaining that i am really 5' 3 and 3/4"", 138-140 lbs., 36c bra. size-wise, i am all over the place. recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an 8 to a 12 from retailer. i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors. everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups. i am not especially big but there was zero cup room.",2,27/04/2018
Cute,"I'm 5'2.5"" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it.",5,14/03/2018
Very flattering,"This was my first choice as one piece suit after having 2 babies, the minute i put it on i just loved how confortable it felt and very flattering in all the right places. the fabric is great. i'm 5'4 and 155 lb i ordered a 10 and it fits great.",5,05/05/2018
"Good quality, cute print but not flattering","Adorable suit, super cute print and great quality, but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.",3,20/05/2018

Too big in the chest,"I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top, so i'm curvy, which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l, and while the m overall fit me better, the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d, and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!",3,25/11/2018
Gorgeous suit with unique detailing,"I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!",5,15/03/2018

Adorable! very flattering!,"This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style, i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and, much to my suprise, it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe, but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!",5,10/02/2018
Unique and flattering swimsuit,"I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable, yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that, this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical, but comfy swimsuit!",5,01/08/2018
Super cute,"I love these bottoms they are super cute, comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.",5,08/03/2018
Please offer this in more colors retailer!,"I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous. 

not only does it fit well and run true to size, it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on, and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a",5,22/06/2018
Best swim skirt ever...please offer more options,"I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4"" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!",5,01/09/2018
Love retailer bathing suits!,Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,5,03/08/2018
"Fits tts, comfortable and flattering","I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case. 
i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot. 
i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits. 
the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary. 
the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these",5,19/03/2018
Amazing bikini bottoms,"Oh how i dread online shopping for bikinis...especially bottoms. however, these bottoms are incredible. the fit is perfect. you know when you are wearing normal underwear and you ask yourself... ""why can't bathing suit bottoms just fit like this?"" these bikini bottoms do! you can't tell by the picture but they are a really great weight...not too thick and bulky...very flattering...perfect rear coverage...doesn't pinch your sides.truly the most flattering bottoms i've found in a long time. worth",5,02/07/2018
Great fit,"These bottoms are comfortable, soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.",5,12/05/2018
Love it!,So soft and comfortable!,5,21/08/2018
"More of these, retailer!!!","Best bathing suit bottoms ever. low-rise doesn't work forever, and this bottom is perfect if you want a little more coverage without being too mom-ish. the ruching gives it a really cute retro feel (as opposed to a granny panties feel). my usual size small fits great, and i definitely did not have the problem another reviewer did with it coming up past the belly button (it hits me right where it hits the model in the photo). i just wish they made it in more prints! there are some really cute top",5,17/06/2018
Great fabric & lots of coverage,"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also, it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so, if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)",5,14/07/2018
Great coverage,I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up. i wear a 26 or 27 and i took the large. the large isn't tight at all but the medium was. i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and don't mind them a little big. i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute.,5,03/05/2018
Perfect!,"Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect.",5,07/02/2018
Nice butt coverage,"I am hippie and always worry about coverage. this was a nice fit, good coverage but did not look old-ladyish.",4,28/09/2018
Great fit,These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!,5,30/01/2018
Vintage beach ready,Love this vintage high waisted bikini bottom! fits true to size. it pulls up to a little past my belly button and the runching is in all the right places. i'm not too sure how it will stay put in the waist area for a dip in the ocean . can't wait to lounge around in it ar the beach though.,5,05/11/2018
Perfect two-piece,"Ok, so who likes to buy bathing suits? apparently i do, because this one arrived today in the white and rust, and i'm buying the black one in a second! i can't pass up such a flattering suit. the ruched bottom gives just enough extra so it's not skin tight to your bottom. and the top has just the right amount of cover. the whole suit is easy to wear, nicely made, and flattering through the roof.",5,18/02/2018
Cute bathing suit bottoms,"This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i can't comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.",5,30/11/2018
"Cute, but....","I like the retro look but these seem to run large to me.  i get they are ruched on the sides.  yet, the bottom has a saggy look.  i got the large but i feel like i should have gotten the medium to fill out the bottom. i already took the strip out and washed so i'm keeping them.  very cute with a bikini top.  maybe i just need a bigger butt.",4,17/03/2018
"Great overall, too darn long","I'm not petite, but i am short at 5'3 and while these fit in all the right places, the leggings are about 5-6 inches too long. i'm still deciding whether to return or hem - but the hemming would have to be professionally done with this material. bummer.",4,18/04/2018
Great leggings!,"I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.",5,28/08/2018
Relaxed fit,"This sweater is far more slouchy and relaxed in fit than in it seems in the photograph. definitely size down. honestly, i kinda love it anyways! the inside is so very soft, and it's perfect for a sleek errand-running or hiking kind of day!",4,06/05/2018
Not for long torsos,"I adored this suit - the style, the colors, the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much, it was practically painful! i'm 5'7', 128 lbs, and usually wear a size small, but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on, everything fit well but the length, though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!",3,22/08/2018
Seea and be seen!,"I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34c, 28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing, there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide, but still the same measurements as another size mentioned, they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd",5,07/04/2018
Amazing,"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner",5,20/04/2018
Perfect one-piece swim suit!,"This is a wonderful one-piece swim suit! it's very flattering on, and the colors and design are just lovely. i also love the suit's vintage feel and that it's sexy without being overly revealing. i seldom pay full price for clothing, but this item is definitely worth every penny!!! i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly.",5,11/02/2018
Great design,"I love this swimsuit - the color, the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me, but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that, although the backside looks great, there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit, this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.",3,05/05/2018
Love my new workout clothes!!,"I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf. i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc... they make me feel sunny and happy :) fabric is light and flexible but stays in place (went running in them) size is accurate, i am usually a 2 on retailer pants/skirts, 27 on jeans, and the small was perfect.",5,24/10/2018
"Fun, and oh so soft!","The color and pattern are so cute and fun. they are also very soft and comfortable. most important, these pants still keep everything covered when i bend into a forward fold.",4,09/04/2018
Flattering,"Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again, but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream ""look at me"" (let's be honest, there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi",5,06/05/2018
Cute suit but order a size (or two!) up!,"Cute suit over all. cups are lightly padded, which is nice if you're concerned about modesty. it runs really small in my opinion. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. i almost always wear a size small, but i ordered a medium in this suit, and although it fits and i'm sticking with the medium, i'm wondering if a large might fit even better. it's also too tight on the leg openings, in my opinion. i like that the straps are adjustable. the pattern is flattering, and i like the suit well enough to keep it. but i",4,07/02/2018
Very small leg openings!,"Uncomfortable in the leg area, but otherwise very flattering.",4,17/11/2018
Runs large,"These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans, and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.",3,30/08/2018
Didn't work for me,"The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).",2,14/07/2018
Sexy with coverage,I wish this came in a petite size! i'm going to do my best to add some stitches in the ruching to keep the middle taught. i'm busty (32 ddd) and the suit had plenty of coverage and lift. i will need to make additional loops in the back latch but this piece is worth all the extra work. i was surprised this worked so well for a short curvy figure. i ordered a medium.,4,19/09/2018
Looks beautiful on!,"I do agree with others that the draping does sit a little funny, but its nothing that a simple tack can't fix. this suit looks incredible on, and does a good job of hiding my ""mom pooch"" while still making me feel sexy with the cutouts. also covers the chest area well.",4,04/10/2018
"Such a unique, flattering swimsuit!",I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it's sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it!,5,24/03/2018
Nice suit.  bottom is higher on back,"Reference: 100#, 5'1, 32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline, where the two orange panels meet the white center panel, that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out, thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section, on the back, c",4,03/12/2018
Surprisingly flattering,"I just received this swimsuit today and love it!  i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts, but i feel it is very flattering.
i was choosing between an xs and s.  i ended up going with xs and am glad i did, i think going up would of caused gaping on the sides.

great suit, only comment is in the description i believe it said the straps are adjustable, but they are not.  also, there is light padding which i appreciate.",5,20/05/2018
"Very cute print/style, but weird cut on top","I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well, but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model, it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however, that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit, and when left in, my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out, m",3,09/09/2018
Perfect suit for mom on the go!,"After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.",5,01/05/2018
Perfect tankini top,"This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!",5,04/05/2018
Mosaic masterpiece,"I bought the mosaic pattern in a small. the pattern and colors look much better in person. the design and quality are solid. the top runs small. it is difficult to put on, but stays in place. i would recommend.",4,27/02/2018
"Cute romper, material... meh","Cute romper, love the pattern but the material seems cheap and flimsy, and is staticky! for the price it should be better quality. also i'm fairly short and hits high on the leg. not sure how anyone taller could make it work.",4,29/01/2018
"Comfy, but too much coverage","I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras, so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras, the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck, or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt, the top of the cup shows. bummer!",3,02/08/2018
Too tight and too big at the same time.,"I'm a 32-a, and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight, but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back, it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it, but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.
the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work, because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.",3,11/10/2018
Best strapless ever,"Hi ladies,
does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do",5,09/11/2018
Runs very small,"This bra runs very small, and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.",2,30/05/2018
Good luck getting it on!,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,2,08/09/2018
Comfortable strapless,"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!",5,19/10/2018
Yasss,"This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra, and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps, a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense), and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage, this bra has it all. so comfy too.",5,23/01/2018
Beautiful online,"I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set, but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly, i returned the set.",3,07/12/2018
No support = lots of side boob,"This suit is so beautiful, and the quality is great. i wanted it to work out, but unfortunately my chest size is not compatible with this bathing suit. i am a 36c and there is zero support (which i assumed when i ordered it, but it was so lovely in the photo i had to give it a try). for those who have a smaller bust, or are more comfortable with a little sexy side profile, this may be perfect. i ordered the large, and the bottoms were a good fit. i am also very petite and the length was good one",4,06/02/2018
Nice change from denim,"I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing, i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length, not too short or long! going to order a second color, i have the plum and love it.",5,14/07/2018
Variety of colors,I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .,5,03/05/2018
Great shorts,These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.,5,11/05/2018
"Great length, true to size despite initial snug","These shorts are comfortable and are just the right length. i have the blue and it isn't as bright as shown in the pictures, but it's a great color nonetheless that coordinates well with many wardrobe items. when i tried on my usual 25, i found the waist fit a bit snug so i bought the 26 for a comfortable fit. i should've stayed with my usual size though, because after wearing for an entire day, the shorts loosened up quite a bit and developed a saggy look to them. i'm so disappointed with this",4,10/09/2018
Perfect shorts,"I love these shorts! they are cuter in person than online. they fit perfectly--casual, somewhat loose, airy feeling. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, took my usual size 25. i wear shorts a little lower on my waist, and i prefer the looser fit. if you plan to wear them up higher on your waist, you can probably size down, but i didn't want to worry about shrinkage, and i wanted them to be easy and comfy. they washed nicely (machine wash, cold, laid flat), light iron touch up. i ordered in moss green, nice color",5,13/05/2018
Stretchy,"Love the length, cut, & placement of pockets. the stretch has positive & negative consequences, though. minuses: easily wrinkled, grow 2 sizes within the day. pluses: comfy, bendy, they're designed to be more of an active short, so the wrinkles & give are quite fine (they only stretch in unnoticeable areas). if we're to repurchase, i'd size down--but i love the bright color  & comfort so much i'm keeping these as is. (i'm a 6-8, should have purchased the 27's.)",4,03/08/2018
So great,"Have been on the hunt for decent shorts all summer. as an elder, i need some length, comfort, style and attractive fit. these meet all the criteria. i'm 5'3"" and got the 31's. they're lightweight but substantial enough to keep their shape. love the faux cuff too. they stretched a bit but still have a perfect fit. got the grey on sale and getting 2 more in other colors left in my size at full price. so good!",5,15/10/2018
Super comfortable but not frumpy,These have become my go-to shorts as i can dress them up or down,5,25/10/2018
Great design,"These are so cute and the colors are great, however, they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once
they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at
least one size, i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik",3,29/09/2018
Super comfy shorts,Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.,5,12/05/2018
Great summer pajama pants.,"I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.",5,31/08/2018
Cute polka dot pattern,I tried these on in the store because the pattern of dots caught my eye and it looked like a nice easy style to wear. the waist hits a bit low. i wasn't crazy about the rayon fabric and would prefer it in cotton. i decided to pass on it for now as i don't really need sleep pants; but i might be tempted if they go on sale.,4,09/05/2018
Dreamy pajama pants,"These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.

i am 5'8"" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.

the length is perfect. 

i just ordered a pair for my sister.",5,27/09/2018
Nice light weight pajamas,"I just purchased these pajamas on-line and they are very pretty in person. i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as i'm only 5'4"". i don't mind a little extra length though because these are just to lounge/sleep in. i think these soft pj's will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable. you'll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top!",5,23/04/2018
Lightweight and well made,"The material on these is super lightweight but still strong, perfect for summer. so hard to find great lounge-sleep clothing in summer for a house without ac. 

illustrations are beautiful in person. i wish they still had more in stock, i want to buy for my mom!

also, i am tall and i like that they are long.",5,14/03/2018
Wanderlust sleep pants,Cozy and beautiful - everything dreamy sleep pants should be. great for gifting. make bedtime feel a little more pampered.,5,20/06/2018
Super soft & comfy,"I love these pants. saw them in-store & couldn't do it at full price but they're a steal on sale. super soft & comfy. love the wide leg. fits true to size. i'm 5'2"" 125 lbs & ordered the xs bc no petite. waistband fits a bit tight but i prefer that to them slipping down. would buy again,",5,07/02/2018
So soft i wear them as pajamas,"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house, because the legs are very wide.. yes, the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned, but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes don't take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants.",5,29/09/2018
Great pants - but have to return them...,"I do love these pants, but they are way too long for me and will have to return them. the petite sizes are sold out. it is true that the elastic in the waistband is not attached to the waistband fabric and does get twisted when you put the pants on. however, to me that is not a show-stopper. sorry i cannot keep them! i do love retailer and will continue shopping with you!",4,27/09/2018
"Lovely, yet annoying.....","I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store, so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in, meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are",3,28/11/2018
Cute and so soft,Great for lounging or running errands. can be dressed up or down. i found them to run at least a size large though.,4,31/03/2018
So soft!!,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.,5,12/11/2018
Lovely lady lounging pants,"Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6"" and the m fit perfectly!'",5,23/04/2018
Not for me,"This appears much more pink in person. i'm not really a pink girl but thought i'd try. 
the way the shoulders are cut makes my defined shoulders/arms look too intense for my liking. this would look nicer on someone more petite and less athletic in my opinion. i like that the bust has slight padding that can make a bra unnecessary for yoga, spin, pilates, ballet, or barre class. it's nice and fitted and true to size. would be really cute on the right person.",4,02/11/2018
Lovely but not for me,I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.,3,09/11/2018
I've been looking...,"This is another ""i've been looking"" for me - a funnel-neck sweatshirt to feign athleticism with. i love it. the material is incredibly soft and warm. the fit is a little snug around a larger bust, and the lines would probably be more flattering on a more... well, modelesque... frame. but i'm thoroughly attached. size up if you're looking for movement.",4,12/08/2018
So excited but then this,I love the pants and it's so soft and they're great. today was the first day i wore them for more than just a try on and i noticed a hole. that's super disappointing but i'm hoping it was just bad luck ;(,4,21/08/2018
Loooooooove it,"I am so love in this top, i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones. i love this top. i work out at a gym that requires tops, but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs. this yoga top has an open back which will show these off, which i really like. the draped back keeps you nice and cool also. and the fit is amazing. i have some extra baby belly that i can't seem to work off-it was invisible in this top.",5,11/11/2018
Pretty but poor quality,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on,3,09/03/2018
Really cute,"This bra is just as cute in person as it is in the pic! i can tell it's pretty well made and i love that it has a lot of little details like on the straps and the cute front-closure and lacy racerback. it also fits pretty true to size, which is a must for me because i often get bras that leave my boobs spilling out. however, this bra isn't the comfiest even though it looks like it would be pretty comfy in the picture.the style doesn't look too stiff or anything and the size i got isn't too tight",4,26/05/2018
Not as beautiful as online,"I'm disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo",1,08/12/2018
Beautiful print,"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry",5,26/05/2018
These will be my go to summer shorts!,"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.

i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!",5,29/10/2018
Nice idea,The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.,3,14/11/2018
Great lounge shirt,"This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.",5,17/10/2018
Super cute.,I absolutely love this shirt. it's a simple tee but the open back adds cute detail to it. i ordered a small and it fit perfectly. color is beautiful also.,5,15/03/2018
Definitely size down,"Very cozy lounge tee, but runs large. i ordered a small rather than my usual medium and could of probably went down two sizes.",4,01/12/2018
"Cozy and soft, easy fit","I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy. at 5'1"", they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length. i came to the website to get the petite length, hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length. these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy.",5,12/02/2018
Great romper,"This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.",5,22/05/2018
Modern meets vintage cool romper,"Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog, i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9"" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!",5,18/07/2018
Chesty women need to size up,"I saw this in the store a few weeks back and desperately wanted it. when it wet on sale, i grabbed it! i normally wear an xs or petite s, but with this one, the petite m was the winner! i am chesty and the top would not have zipped up had i gone any smaller. it is a bit wide on the bottom, and i agree with the reviewer who said it should be a bit more tailored on the bottom. still, with some awesome heels, this is a great summer piece! the lining is great quality. love it!",4,24/10/2018
Unique modern turtleneck,"Nice lines and texture but fit is very tight and i experienced the sizing to run small. i am 5'6"" and 115# with small frame. i usually wear xs or s from retailer, so ordered the turtleneck in small. the size small was super tight. i love the design so exchanging my order for a medium.",4,12/02/2018
"Nice turtlenceck, flattering style","I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!",5,01/11/2018
Versatile and flattering,"This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black.

unless you are very small framed, i would recommend sizing up; or, if you typically wear a m or a l, go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips), large biceps, and a 34b chest, and i went with the l because",5,20/11/2018
Sooo soft!!,"Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large, so i will try a medium.",5,13/11/2018
Soooooo soft!,"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design"".",5,03/04/2018
Soft but,"These are extremely soft but do run about one size too big with one exception; the opening to pull your feet through that bag nicely around your ankles is soooooo small that you have to work to pull the heel of your foot out. for me, these are dual duty pants; casual wear like to the grocery store or coffee shop trip and second as great soft pj bottoms. though the ankles are small, they do not feel tight at all because the fabric is really that soft. they work well with both my sneakers and clas",4,25/07/2018
The coolest pants,"When i tried them on, i didn't want to take them off! they are so soft, so stylish, they drape your body just the right way, they are stretchy, so even though i am wearing 30 in jeans, i took s regular! run hone and tried it on with moss cowled side-zip tunic, 2 different booties and aquaflora reversible vest, all variations and combos looked really cool and great! i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top (warm-up pullover in charcoal), looked like high couture! the color i",5,28/09/2018
Perfect,I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.,5,22/04/2018
Great for the beach,"I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small, i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length, short but not too short.",5,06/05/2018
Summer and spring go to tunic,I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.,5,22/03/2018
Beautiful embroidery,"This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however, it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side, but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale, so i am keeping it.",4,17/06/2018
Great cover up,"This cover up is precious. i ordered both sizes because i was unsure of how either would fit since there was only a s/m and m/l. there is not a whole lot of variation between the two. i wear a size 10 pants and the s/m fit, but i may still keep the m/l instead for fear that it may shrink when washed. the garment is hand wash only which i will do because of the delicacy of the tassels. that's a little high maintenance for a cover up but i am willing to do it because it really is a cute cover up.",4,20/02/2018
Beach ready,"I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.",5,03/08/2018
Super cute light weight beach cover up,"I bought this for a beach getaway with the purpose of using it as a beach cover up. it was great for this purpose! however, i also bought it thinking that i could use it as a dress during the summer. i probably won't be using it for purposes other than the beach as it is extremely light weight and a bit sheer. also, although it's hard to see it in the photo, there are slits on the side of the dress. all of these elements make it perfect for the beach when you want a breezy, light-weight dress bu",4,20/07/2018
Cartagena cover-up,"I love this cover-up. it does feel big when you first put it on, however, you just pull on the strap and tie it to your liking. i am 5'2, so this hits a little lower than on the model in the picture, but it does not drag on the floor. this is my new favorite cover-up. now, all i need is the sun!",4,11/06/2018
"Basic shorts, cute pattern!","Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets, as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said, the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length, which i appreciate.",5,04/04/2018
Summer time shorts,"These shipped fast!!! the fit is good. these shorts have some stretch to them, which is nice. there is a green/blue color in the fine detail making them versatile with a few different colors of tops. true to size. the length is perfect for my taste. i am 5'7"".",4,13/05/2018
Nice shorts - love the tie front!,"I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too ""short."" the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them.",5,05/09/2018
"Cute, breezy shorts","I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.",5,24/11/2018
Adorable shorts!,These shorts are so cute and comfortable! you can wear any color top and they are very flattering! they fit tts.,5,28/07/2018
Great lace shorts.,"I got these in black and i had tried on the gray in the store, they run small at the waist. i usually wear xs or small, but i ordered a medium. they are very comfortable on a warm day. they look great with a loose, tucked in blouse or tee. the down side is they catch and the lace pulls and gets fuzzy when rubbing against things. i realized this after a day of wear. i haven't washed yet, but plan to hand wash.",4,30/03/2018
Soooo disappointed!,"I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man",1,23/10/2018
Constantly needs adjusting,"I wanted to love this dress, and i don't. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again, very often.",4,08/03/2018
Easy machine washable dress,"I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit",5,16/05/2018
Just don't wash it,"I loved this dress...until i washed it. the label says machine wash cold and lay flat to dry...which i did (washed on delicate). now it's not the same dress. it's too short and not as soft and i feel so much differently about it. i wish the label would just instruct to dry clean, i would pay the extra expense to still have the dress i loved. just kind of annoyed. so it's an awesome dress, just be prepared to dry clean it or risk shrinkage if you wash it.",3,27/06/2018
Fun dress,I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!,5,27/06/2018
Perfect summer robe,"I'm fussy about robes. i'm fairly small (size 2 or 4) and a lot of robes swamp me. in the smaller size, this robe fit well and was flattering. the material is soft but absorbent. the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy. the wrap is generous--i wear this robe just out of the shower and don't feel exposed.",5,09/05/2018
Terrace robe,"Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!",5,07/08/2018
Please stop going down in fabric quality,"I've been wearing these shorts for years, i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure, they're great when you try them on in the store..soft, comfortable, flattering, but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times, sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall, and a",2,05/02/2018
Quality changed,"Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material, now, the wash isn't as real, almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why, pilcro?? the sizing is about the same, they run a little large due to the",2,19/10/2018
Shorts aren't what they were,Shorts don't fit me like they did the first time and i've only worn them twice! the material isn't what is use to be. it stretches out to fast. i don't think i will be buying these again. wish i could take them back.,2,23/09/2018
Love these,"I've been buying and returning several denim shorts lately searching for the right pair. these are fantastic. they are so so soft and comfy. i'd say they run slightly big but not to the point where i needed to size down like i do with the hyphen chinos. love that they are not so short but not too long either and can be adjusted by how you roll them. these are a nice medium wash and i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and went w my normal size 26. seems like they may stretch out a little but that's ok bc then they",5,30/04/2018
Great short,"I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect.",5,18/07/2018
Zip hoodie not a pullover,"This hoodie is really cute-i got the polka dot color and it is very soft and roomy. i am normally a small but got the medium and it fits exactly how i wanted. however-it is not a pullover and instead zips up. so odd that the pic of the hoodie is a pullover. debated returning because i wanted a pullover, but have decided to keep it because of how soft it is.",4,07/12/2018
"Gorgeous, soft hoodie","I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look",5,18/03/2018
Zipper?,Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.,3,19/03/2018
Fleeced tula hoodie,"I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???",2,22/01/2018
This is a zippered hoodie,Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,1,20/11/2018
Wide legs but good quality,"The color and the fabric in these shorts is quite nice as is the length. i didn't order the pilcro bermudas because another reviewer said the legs were quite wide. unfortunately, these shorts also have wide legs. i'm going to have them tailored so they hug the legs as in the picture rather than billowing out. i do not have skinny thighs(don't i wish!) and i was surprised that the fit was not as pictured. if you're ok with wide legs or can get them at a price at which you're ok spending extra for",4,29/11/2018
Re-ordering two sizes down,I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,5,08/03/2018
"Great color, great fit, bring on the sun.","I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level 99 shorts i just had to order. they arrived and are as good as i hoped. the fit is great, the length is great (i don't like shorty shorts) and i love the color. the photo is very true to life in regard to color. i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer.",5,26/11/2018
"Comfortable, soft, flattering lounge pants",I bought these in the navy stripe and they're soft and comfortable. i'm between a small and a medium and the medium works here -- i could not have worn a small in these. the narrow stripes make the pants flattering and the drape is lovely. i wish they had pockets but i guess i can't have everything!,4,04/09/2018
Great summer staple,"Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.",5,25/03/2018
Not for me but seemed like good quality,The romper was really quite and looks just like the picture. quality felt good too. but when i tried it on the sleeves just didn't look right on me. they were too long and too big. for that reason i decided to return it.,4,12/08/2018
Surprised by how much i like it,It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.,5,25/06/2018
Gto for a summer night out,"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit.",5,08/03/2018
Adorable!,Very trendy and very cute. i love how it fits perfectly without being too tiny on the backside. the material is a bit flimsy for the price.,4,29/04/2018
Perfect - at first :(,"I loved this romper so much! the material is thin, but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy, like on the model, to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.",2,15/07/2018
Too narrow for this romper,"I wanted to like this romper, it is very cute and colorful, but to top was overywhelming for my size and made me look even shorter.",3,26/11/2018
Not as expected,"It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didn't live up to my expectations. i'm 5'3, 115 and got a s. it looked odd on me...a little too short on the bottom, a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price. i returned it.",2,14/05/2018

Great color,"This romper was so cute and with the great reviews i thought i needed to try it...but once trying it on i realized it was an odd fit, there is not enough fabric to make it look as relaxed as it does on the model. also, the sleeves were a bit wider than they look in the picture. would probably work well for someone with a petite figure.",4,21/04/2018
I love it!,"I wasn't sure how this was going to look on me, but it was so darned cute, i had to give it a try. and i love it! i'm 5'4"" around 130lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try. the medium fit best. the length is perfect. hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same. the material is light but nothing see thru about it. it is slimming and looks so cute on! so glad i gave it a try.",5,18/10/2018
Love!,This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!,5,27/02/2018
Great romper - but read the reviews about washing!,"I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it! i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size. it falls well and i love the blousy look on top. it is expensive at full price, but i purchased it with a promotional discount. luckily, before i washed this (as the tag says handwash only), i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk. i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon. dryel in",5,04/08/2018

Perfect cover-up,This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.,5,06/07/2018
Perfect summer coverup,"I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.",5,24/03/2018
Soft and light,"This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.",5,17/07/2018
Pretty cotton caftan,"This is a lovely, light coverup with a beautiful pattern, however, in the catalogue it appears blush pink when in reality it is white. the model must be wearing a pinkish swimsuit underneath the caftan giving it the allusion of being a color which it is not. i still like it enough to keep it but am disappointed that the item description did not mention this optical illusion.",4,06/04/2018
Cuteandcomfy,"Comfortable, cool-perfect summer tank. ordered  one for my daughter(small), had to get myself one too(medium)-both tts. great for errand runs, around house, lounging, sleeping. seems better made than more expensive tops ordered as of late. good job retailer",5,12/11/2018

The perfect suit,"The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering, particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable, and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys, it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).",5,21/11/2018
Beautiful print,"The print on this top is even more gorgeous in person. the fit was great, and the removable halter strap is always a plus. this swim top, however, doesn't have padding, and the material is slightly thin, so this could cause an issue for some. overall, however, it looked great. for reference, i am an a cup, and purchase the small.",4,30/04/2018
"Beautiful, but beware! ""cheeky"" coverage","This is a great bikini bottom. i purchased this along with the matching top, and you can definitely tell a difference in the quality of the material for these. the print is beautiful, and the cut is very flattering - my only ""issue"" is a matter of personal preference - these were much ""cheekier"" on me than the photo of the model (i have a larger behind). for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in bottoms, and purchased a medium. sizing up would have only presented an issue in the waist fitting.",4,26/06/2018
Great bikini top if you cna find the right fit,"I ordered this top in a size 'm' as i heard mara hoffman runs small. the size chart on her site would have me order a size 's' as i have a 33"" bust (33-25-~37). however, my bra size is a 30d or 32c and the size m is what fit. therefore a m might also fit a 34b and a 36a as the back is adjustable. it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for me.

the only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t",5,30/07/2018
Perfect symmetry in lifesaver colors,"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos.
.
i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t",5,24/11/2018
Two for one,"This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors, fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site. 
.
 i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage, not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support, and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w",5,22/11/2018
"Vibrant & comfortable, what else could i ask for?","This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges. 
.
i got the size 's' according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site. i'm 5'2"" currently 33-25-37ish without a bra on (bra size 30d, 32c, even a 28dd if i can find it). the front coverage is perfect. it also fits around the back, but i",5,21/11/2018
Vibrant colors & sweet side detail,"Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit, just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top.
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34""; fuller thighs and bottom, so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.

Beautiful,These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..,5,21/02/2018
Perfect fit shorts,"I typically wear boring shorts. you know - khaki. i saw these in the store and had to try them on. true to size in the waist, not too short, and the leg fit was perfect (slim without being skin tight). the pattern is far from boring. i can't wait to wear them out.",5,14/03/2018
"Super cute, comfy but easy to dress up","Love shorts that i can dress down w/ a chambray top or that i dress up w/ heeled sandals and a blouse. this is perfect!
i found them to run a tad big.
i have thin legs but don't have a small waist at all. i took a 0 in them, i'm usually more like a 2 on bottom.",5,06/12/2018
Run large,"First off, they are much prettier irl than in the photos online. they fit very large on me. i am usually a 8 or 10 but have hips so ordered the10. wrong decision. i needed the 8.",5,09/10/2018
Lovely,These shorts are divine. the fabric is sturdy and there is a weave of sparkle that i did not perceive from the picture.,4,26/07/2018
Beautiful and stylish,"These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see, but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top, and i'm good to go!",5,18/11/2018
So comfy!,"This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire), which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge, as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras, but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!",5,01/12/2018
Definitely size up,"If your looking for a nice quality basic tee, this is it. nothing special, but the fabric is a nice soft cotton with a little stretch. the cut is long and lean so i would highly recommend sizing up. i sized up from my usual medium to a large and it's still quite form fitting. i'm 5'2"", 35a/b bust, 28 waist, 39 hips.",4,17/06/2018
I liked tehse but,"My stylist didn't love them... they are well made, the waist line is comfortable and the embroidery is very pretty. the hem is loose-fitting, perhaps that is what she thought was not as flattering... the material is airy, nice for summer, i think you should give these a try,,, for me, perhaps it is my muscular legs that made her hesitate.",4,05/06/2018
Eye-catching and unique,"These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures, but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.",4,07/10/2018
Great summer shorts,"I love these. i like that they're fancier than your basic summer shorts but they still look casual and effortless. unlike the other reviews i found that they run large. i'm usually a 4, maybe a 6, and the 4 is roomy.  still looks good though just rides a bit lower on my hips.",4,04/08/2018
Perfect fit and color,"These shorts are comfortable but so stylish. even though, i love many of retailer shorts, these are one of my favorites.",4,14/07/2018
Great shorts,These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!,5,05/04/2018
Ironing - ugh!,"I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist), so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear, but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o",3,07/07/2018
"Super cute, stylish, versatile shorts!","Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai",5,26/11/2018
Nice summer shorts,"These shorts were exactly as expected. they are nice thin shorts perfect for a hot summer in texas. i have just worn a few times out running errands in high 90 degree weather and they were perfect. i bought the grey and they are a nice change from jean shorts, but still match just about any top. i typically wear a size 0, but after reading the reviews purchased a size 2, so i would say they run a little small. they are slightly snug in the waist, but i ordered online and liked them enough to kee",4,14/09/2018
Absolutely love,I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.,5,17/11/2018
Love these but run small,"I followed the other reviewers who said these fit true to size. i have to disagree. i normally wear an 8 in shorts, which is what i ordered, and the fit is too tight in the waist and butt. i'm exchanging for 10. i really like the color and fun accents. i really hope i can get these in 10!",4,08/06/2018
Cute but disappointing,"Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.",2,07/06/2018
Great shorts,The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short. perfect length as well! dress up or down. love these shorts and wish there were more colors!,5,07/11/2018
High-waist + comfy,"I have vowed to only purchase high-waisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style! these shorts did not disappoint. i love that they're versatile enough to wear with a cute top + wedges or with a t-shirt and flats. great find! (i got my normal sz. 25 which is usually a tight fit, these zipped up perfectly though!)",5,18/08/2018
Versatile shorts,"These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.",5,14/03/2018
Too shortwaisted,"So cute and so adorable but too short for my body in size small. i'm going to try a size medium.
fabric is a nice weight cotton. lining is good, sleeves are a not too tight.",4,07/02/2018
If only,I was really happy when i saw this romper online and ordered it right away. unfortunately being larger chested i thought i would size up to a medium. bad choice. now i have a beautiful romper that is too big for me. i will be getting this one tailored.,3,29/05/2018
Cute... if you're planning to hold it on,"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.",2,11/07/2018
Super adorable!,"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly.",5,13/10/2018
Beautiful! ...but not for a long torso,"Hahaha! as gorgeous as this piece is, i look absolutely ridiculous in it. i am 5'7'' 115 lbs but have a long torso and so the crotch area is, well, a little unflattering to say the least:) i am really sad because i shy away from shorts due to my year round pale skin, but this fabric and color worked really well for me. the length of the shorts is also nice and the back is beautiful! i've never had a romper and i was truly hoping this one would be the one for me. it is all round perfect...if you",4,23/02/2018
Not so great,"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.",2,02/11/2018
"Yay, another dress","I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter",5,06/10/2018
Poor fit,"While the styling is cute, the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.",3,11/10/2018
Simple but large,"I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure, but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.",2,09/05/2018
I really wanted to love this dress,"So, this dress is extremely comfortable, but it's just really awkward. i am on the fence about keeping it, my husband loves it and thinks i should. it just draws attention to the belly, so any issues after having kids, is very noticeable. not to mention the huge cutouts for the arms. very comfortable, but not sure if i will keep it.",3,24/01/2018
Comfortable,"This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits, but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!",5,09/02/2018
Too big armholes,"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.",2,30/09/2018
Sporty elegance,"I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.",5,25/08/2018
Great summer dress,This dress is amazing and spans multiple uses. i brought it to st. john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress. it is flattering and a light but durable material. the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden. overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it.,5,30/04/2018
Little big in the armholes,"This dress had a nice silhouette, but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!",3,22/07/2018
Great skort,Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.,5,30/10/2018
Beautiful but not the best quality,"I used my birthday month discount to treat myself to this gorgeous chemise and matching robe in the mauve. the color is prettier in person than on my computer. i bought it in size m, and size m clothes are normally a little big on me. this chemise fits, but there is no extra room or looseness. i am disappointed in the quality of the pieces. i have several beautiful 100% silk undergarments that i bought for myself in the 80s and 90s, and i am comparing this chemise (& robe) to those. this silk us",3,08/04/2018
Elegant and comfy,"I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of ""show it,"" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.",5,02/10/2018
Coincidence,"I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually, i like all the new styles at retailer right now), and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the",5,07/07/2018
Great leggings,"I bought a xs in black. i like the weight, texture, and thickness of this fabric. it feels like it smoothes over and holds the lines of my body in well. may be the other reviewer got a pair out of an odd batch, which could mean there are inconsistencies? i would like to see how the color and the stretch holds up with future washes. it would have gotten five stars since if it came in petitte length. but i will pick up a couple of more if it hits sale.",4,09/06/2018
Cool for the summer,"I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!",5,13/09/2018
Size down ladies!,This is a very unique piece. it seems to be easy to wear and it is very comfy. but i normally wear a medium/size 8 and it was too big. i might size down to a petite medium of just go for small. it seems this might be a trial and error type of outfit.,4,18/02/2018
Love this romper,"Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4"", 105 lbs and generally consider myself proportioned, but curvy on the bottom, and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams, but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5"" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable, forgiving, and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps, because at the ti",5,15/08/2018
Fun romper,Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.,5,26/08/2018
Casual layering piece,"This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.",5,01/08/2018
Love the top and the message!,"Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.",5,06/09/2018
Adorable,"Just so i'm clear, the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion, but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online, it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.

also b/c i'm 5'8, the small was just a tad too short, definitely no bending !

i'm 5'8 tall, 127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom",3,29/05/2018
Cutest romper,"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer.",5,04/04/2018
See-through shorts,"I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.",1,03/03/2018
"Cute shorts, but runs big","Cute shorts with great fabric (and lined so they lay smooth over your body). i really love that the material has a dressier feel, but they ran a bit large and looked sort of frumpy on me (curvy body, 5'7'', 150). i'm returning them and trying a small. elastic waist is great for me after having a baby, but would look just fine under a belt or covered by a shirt.",4,29/10/2018
Comfortable but not for extreme yogis,This bra is incredibly comfortable but not meant for practices that involve a lot of movement (i.e.: vinyasa) but is perfect for lounging and personal practice. the orange is a beautiful color,4,21/11/2018
Love the petite!,"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",5,15/07/2018
Soft,These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,5,06/02/2018
"Great colors, wide straps, sheer","I ordered the tangerine color of this tank. it's a great color, slightly heathered.

what i like most about this tank are the riders straps and the depth of the scoop neck. it allows for a normal bra and could be dressed up or down.

i wore the tank out and about, and it was comfy and pretty. later, though, my husband came home and asked if i knew it was see through. eek! sure enough, it is pretty sheer in certain lights. next time, i will wear a cami underneath. though i wish it were a bit",4,30/04/2018
Perfect tank!,"I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.",5,15/07/2018
Love it,This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.,5,04/03/2018
"Quality, but top runs large and bottoms small","I loved the design of this suit when i saw it online.
 the material is definitely high quality and the bottoms i knew would stay put, if they had fit me in the first place. i ordered a size medium in both top and bottom. the bottoms were much much too small and the top was just ever so slightly too large. i should've known something was up with sizing because all of the larges were sold out already. i think i could've used a large bottom and a size small top.",4,17/11/2018
Buy this robe!,"Buy this robe before its gone! my friend and i each bought this robe... it feels amazing and makes a girl feel pretty!. i bought the xs/s (34c, 26"" waist), but i tried on the m/l and could have made that work too. love!",5,04/11/2018
Lune embroidered robe,Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!,5,05/07/2018
"No ""lined cups""","I just got this suit in and i was pretty excited about it, however it does not have lined cups like it says. no boob support whatsoever, though i think the pattern distracts enough that i'm keeping it anyways. (34dd). i do think it might be too short for a taller person. i'm only 5'4"" and it just barely comes up high enough to cover me, and i don't think big boobs are the reason. also it is pretty cheeky, which it does mention. maybe a little expensive, but i did use a coupon.",4,13/07/2018
New favorite!,"This bra is everything. looks good and feels good. so happy with this purchase. for reference, i am a c cup and got a medium. i do have a little side boob action happening but i'm still happy with the fit of the medium",5,25/11/2018
Beautiful and comfortable,These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty. i highly recommend.,5,07/12/2018

Perfect pjs,I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!,5,13/04/2018
Summer perfection,Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.,5,27/02/2018

Light and airy pjs,"I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!",5,24/03/2018
Lovely and perfect for summer,"I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s.",5,03/08/2018
Comfy summer pajama pants,"Like the last reviewer i saw these pants in the store and decided to give them a try. i'm glad i did because i absolutely love them and they were the last pair on the rack. the fabric is nice and light, perfect for warm summer evenings and the pattern is really pretty almost like a watercolor painting. this is my third pair of sleep pants by elouise and i absolutely love them all.",5,25/08/2018

Comfy and cute,"I spotted this pj pants in the store, tried it on, and love it! the material is very soft and comfortable. the fabric is on the thin side, thus, one star off the quality. the pattern/color varies, the one i got has more pinkish flowers. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, and size s fits nice. i could probably go down to a size xs, but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy, therefore size s fits better. the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite. it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe",5,26/03/2018
Mighty little midi,"This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and hap",5,29/03/2018
Cool beach pants,"I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit, light enough for the beach. they have my size finally! i'm a regular 12 and m worked well for me. can't wait to wear these with a nice top.",5,30/05/2018
Perfect for hot summer nights!,The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!,5,20/08/2018
Pretty spring flowers,"I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a",5,14/09/2018
A few problems,"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.",2,15/04/2018

am 5'10 and slim these fit great, its so hard to find pants that fit tall slender women.",5,28/08/2018
Not for petites,Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.,2,16/11/2018
Perfect!,"This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic, soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece , but the pink detail on the trim, along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.",5,03/12/2018
Zoe slip,"When i saw this slip/nighty on-line i loved it! most of the night-gowns i own are from retailer and i am very pleased with them. i ordered my normal size small and it fit well. for reference i am 5' 1"" and 120lbs, 35c. the only slight issue is that the fabric is quite sheer, not a big deal since one is wearing this item to sleep in, but it would have been better in my opinion if it wasn't so see-through. also this may not matter to anyone but the stitching along the top is a bright neon pin",4,20/07/2018
Cute and sweet,Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.,5,12/03/2018
Wonderful one piece,"I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.",5,10/04/2018
"Cute design, impossible fit","I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine, but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck, it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup, and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and, for this reason, would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate, because the design is so pretty.",2,11/09/2018
Cups too big,This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.,3,07/08/2018
So cute but design failure,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are,2,11/09/2018
Runs very small,"Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on, which is a first. was very cute in theory, but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).",3,15/10/2018
Super cute * runs small,"I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews. i'm so happy i did! i couldn't be happier with the fit, quality and design. for reference, i am 5'8, size 4 and smaller chested (small b cup) and went with a medium. i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it!",5,22/06/2018
Bad cups!,"The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.",1,25/08/2018
Fits true to size - high quality,"I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the ""size up"" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i",5,06/09/2018
This product is deceiving,"This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.",2,24/10/2018
Beautiful swimsuit,"This swimsuit is beautiful. the quality is excellent. controls without being too thick. the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous. i am curvy , 34dd and the top fit perfect. good bottom coverage. very happy with this purchase.",5,04/12/2018
Swim review,"This suit is really flattering and comfortable. i love the pattern and the removable strap. the only downside is the top of the suit folds down easily showing the lining at the top. this has been the case with other suits i've bought from retailer, but it's so flattering that i can live with that flaw.",4,22/05/2018
Great design,"I loved the design of this suit. the zigzag pattern is great at covering up any tummy issues but the print is still fun and not frumpy. i got a compliment the first day i wore it. it is a great one piece that gives great coverage and yet is still fun. the only thing i don't like about the suit is that the top of the suit slips over showing the lining. i read this in other reviews and it is true. while that is annoying, i liked the suit enough to keep it.",4,07/09/2018
Great fitted top,I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.,5,13/02/2018
Cute and comfy,Mom loves these and she looks great going to the gym! the cut-outs are so cute!,4,10/09/2018
Love these yoga crops,"Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3"" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend.",5,24/01/2018
Cute tank,I love this style of tank top with the wider straps. very flattering but yes the armholes are big and i noticed the sizing is different with each color. i normally wear an xs but in the gray and blue i bought s to have a little room. i also bought the black color but the s was huge! i exchanged for an xs so hopefully it will fit better. it had to be ordered. it definitely stretches out as you wear it though.,4,13/10/2018
Love!!,"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",5,09/08/2018
Ok for the price,"I ordered the black (not yet available ) through my store, as the xs was too big, and we tried ordering xs petite but it was not yet available. so we ordered xxs. (i am 115lbs). it fits nicely, but - as mentioned in previous review - it is thin. not see through in black, but thin. cut is nice though, i still think petite would fit me better i n length, but xxs was good... got a think if i will keep or not as htis is a nice summer basic...",4,12/09/2018
White tank,I bought the white tank and the small fits me but it's very low cut for me. the white is sheer as well. i usually wear an xs or a small and i would be curious to see what the xs would fit like in the sense of how low cut it is.,4,15/04/2018
Hit or miss,"I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly, but is more flattering that way.",4,25/06/2018
Please bring back more!!!,"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",5,20/10/2018
Awesome basic tee,"I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too, very reasonable. i want one in every color.",5,01/10/2018
Great fit,I bought the fuschia colored tank to wear under a sweater for the fall. great color. fits well.,4,01/12/2018
Awesome tank or layering piece!,I really like this top. perfect underneath cardigans or on its own. the fabric is a bit thin so light colors may be see through. love the wider style so there is no bra show. versatile. i see myself purchasing more of these!,4,16/06/2018
Could be great,"I have bought 4 of these, but after 1st wash on 2 of them and they were in a lingere bag, there are little holes on the front of each, now they are bum around shirts. if they go on sale i will purchase, but the material needs to be better.",4,10/02/2018
Nice tank,"Like the look of this tank, ran a bit larger than expected at the neck but overall happy with the purchase",4,19/03/2018
Great spin on a basic tank,"This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!",5,25/01/2018
Great basic tank,"The wide strap style is very flattering. this tank is fitted in my normal size small, it fits like the model in the cobalt blue color. i'm 5'7"" 120lbs. if you want more room, i'd size up. it is low cut, but not inappropriately so. fits like the picture shows.",4,21/02/2018
Prefect little tank,"Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top, easily dress up and down!",4,12/10/2018
Good basic but runs a bi big,"I love this tee, and am a picky tee person. it runs big, the striped colors are even bigger but i washed in warm and dried them and they are great. super soft and sexy for a tee! i bought the xxs and i am 115 lbs and 5'2"". i like the longer length -- cute with leggings. not 5 stars due to stretched out arm holes.",4,04/04/2018
Sexiest t eva!!!,I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.,5,08/10/2018
Sheer but great fit,"I wish there were 100 colors, i'd buy them all. the white is super sheer, but i'll use it as a bottom layer for something.",4,22/03/2018
"Great tank, love the wider straps",I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,5,13/08/2018
Fun tshirt design,"Actually you would think just another tshirt but actually with the wide straps it changes it up enough to really be cute.  i like the look it adds.  i really want to get more colors.   i normally wear everything from retailer in small , and even though this fit it was small for a small.  i will keep it but i think i will buy others in medium.",4,13/11/2018
Love this simple tank!,I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.,5,28/04/2018
Wide-strap tank,"The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic, thin tank, but it's a good every day, wear all the time staple.",4,07/02/2018
"Perfect cut, very thin",Love love love the cut of this tank top. it's is super thin and see thru however. wish it was made a bit thicker. i got it in white and you can see right thru it. however the cut is so fabulous i can over look that.,4,06/04/2018
Special tee,"There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...",5,12/08/2018
Great summer top!,"I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!",5,20/07/2018
Beware - not enough bottom coverage!,"Such a cute pattern, and i loved the fold-over design, but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms, and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband, but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent",2,05/02/2018
Cheeky!,These bottoms are very cute but defiantly cheeky! i would recommend sizing up if you want to have more coverage.,4,22/04/2018
Australian sizing!!,So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i'm usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn't even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for.,3,30/11/2018
Print may not be symmetrical as pictured,I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.,4,09/02/2018
See-through,"These are soft, silky, and super comfortable, the fit is very flattering, especially with muscular legs. beautiful pattern and colors, fit like a glove. however, unfortunately, they felt like pj pants, i know they are beach pants, but they were pretty see-through. for the price, i decided to return and wait for potential sale... 
ps i needed heels as they are long if you usually get petite.",4,02/06/2018
Great fit,This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.,5,03/02/2018
Pretty bathing suit,"Cute bright colored suit a little more orange than pink i prefer pink but the fit didn't quite work for me 

 the bottoms were a little too big and the top although was fairly well proportioned just didn't look right altogether 

 purchase the extra smalls in both  and have since returned 

 i do love the suits that retailer has been offering would just love to be able to try them on in the store
 nice quality good colors",4,01/08/2018
Cute but baggy!,"I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice,  but if it sits at my natural waist,  the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad,  i love the print and ease of this design.",3,26/07/2018
Cute and comfy,Very cute and true to size if not just a little large up top.,4,19/04/2018
Best romper!,"I love this romper so much! i'm a tall girl (5'9), so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isn't too short. the length on this is perfect. this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great. the material is a great quality, and its really comfortable! i'm 5'9 34b bra, i usually range between an xs and s, i went with the s on this one and it fits great! i definitely recommend this if you're thinking about it.",5,31/01/2018
Totally adorable,"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple, but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa",5,27/11/2018
Great shape,"This romper has a great shape! you know that long saggy grandma butt that some rompers give you....this one is not that! it's cute and adorable and those long stitched pockets are so flattering to us short folk! i'm 5'4"" on a good day, 125#, 32g and this fits great. i picked up an xs (i'm never an xs) and it was very flattering. i'm usually a 4/27 in pants for reference. the v-neck and the way the shoulder seams start to angle in at the top make this very flattering. it is long enough for me to",5,28/11/2018
Love this romper,"I ordered both a small and a medium because i have lost weight and seem to be in between sizes currently. lately i am anywhere from a 6 to a 10 in most retailer sizes. almost 5'4"" and @140 lbs. i could have gotten away with the small. but my bust size is 36c/d. the small fit but didn't hang as well or feel as comfortable around the chest as the medium. i agree with a previous reviewer that this romper does have a tendency to hang awkwardly at the waist until and unless you pull the drawstring tigh",4,21/09/2018
Very cute!,"I have been looking at rompers for a while but being that i'm 40, a lot of stores seem to carry rompers that are super short. i think these are the perfect length for summer (and for me!). it's cute! i am 5'5"" and 110 pounds and i ordered the xs. i docked one start because the top part seems to have a bit of excess fabric. if i pull the waist up, the top 1/2 balloons out a little awkwardly. but if i pull the shorts down so that the drawstring is resting lower than my natural waist, it looks okay",4,24/01/2018
On the fence about this one,"I find this romper looks much more crisp on the picure than in real life. i find it more slouchier and shapeless even though i went with my ""smaller size"". the material is very soft, but thin, that is maybe the reason. i am not sure if i am going to keep. i wanted a bit more stunning look for my money. not saying this might be a great romper for somebody else however",4,12/11/2018
Perfect summer comfy short!,"These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.",5,09/07/2018
I could live in these.,"The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.",5,04/09/2018
Love these shorts!,These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!,5,04/12/2018
Not for my hips,"I'm 140 at 5' 8"". pear shape. the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didn't lay flat. loose on leg opening - which i liked. but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider. i got a medium",2,07/06/2018
Perfect casual dress!,"This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight, will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d, 27, 35",5,23/03/2018
Casual and comfortable,"This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy, yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is, or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation, as it won't get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item, and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference, i am 38-26-38.",5,02/05/2018
"Give me more art dept, please...","I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????",5,09/10/2018
Softest shorts on the planet,"These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24,25, or 0. you will not regret this purchase.",5,31/01/2018
Pleasantly surprised,I saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it. i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs (real ones) and i was not sure it would provide enough support. it is the cutest suit ever. have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldn't go for a jog. ha. it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit.,5,01/04/2018
Can't wait to wear it!,"I love the look of this right away. i found it ran small to retailer's clothes (where i'm inexplicably a xs or s here i was a m). i also am a dd, so would have appreciated more support, but as the other reviewer, i can get away with it to wear this cute suit.",4,15/05/2018
"So cute, but so small!","The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however, the bottoms run so small. for reference, i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start, both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!), i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly, i'm giving up and returning. 
only order this suit if you're super, super tiny on the bottom.",3,30/10/2018
Runs very small,Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large.,3,04/11/2018

"So cute, but not for me","This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy, seems well made and fit nicely. but, although it fit technically, i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all. 

the suit is kind of a neoprene material, so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit, so i think even though it isn't lined, it might not be see-through, but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit, i think it",3,23/05/2018
Great suit!,"This suit is the most flattering suit i have owned in a while, as well as the most comfortable! though the suit is not lined, the light wetsuit material holds me in and is supportive, despite the open back and the slight looseness of it. if you do any water sports, i think this is a perfect suit. i did purchase some silicone covers for myself, however, to avoid looking like a farrah fawcett throwback.",4,04/02/2018
Great quality; on the warmer side,"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.

Very soft,The straps are long but work ok for me. the material is very soft and the color (pink) is very nice. this is a tank you can wear under almost anything as the soft silky fabric will allow whatever you wear to glide right over it....no sticking!,5,09/03/2018
Great fitted tee,Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!,5,17/10/2018
Cute but tricky zipper,"These are super cute shorts - great pattern, pockets (yay!) and really nice fabric. but, they're just a little too short for me, run a little small, and the side zipper is something of a pain -- i don't know if it was a construction issue on the pair i received or a stupid user issue but it seemed as if the seam with the zipper was just off -- not really a side seam but more toward the back. plus, the zipper sticks on the waistband seam making it even more difficult to zip. i wish i had read the",4,31/05/2018
Great romper,"So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4"" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.",5,20/03/2018
"Attractive and good quality, but runs large","I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing, but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however, they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5', i typically buy size 0 or xs, but these looked a bit ridiculous on me, with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash, since they're 100% cotton, and that helped some, along with getting rid of the creases from shipping",3,22/07/2018
Great for junk in the trunk,"I am 5'7 and 125lbs w a muscular bubble butt from climbing and biking. usually have trouble w shorts fitting right because my legs and waist don't match my butt. these shorts run large , i got a medium which should have been okay but they stretched out quite a bit after one wear so am returning for a small. it's crazy for my butt to be in a ""small""anything. so- if you are a skinny minny, or have a flat butt, these may not work for you in that you don't have anything to hold these up besides the",5,09/02/2018
Every woman's cami,"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, doesn't ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m",5,28/11/2018
Great shorts!,"These shorts are beautiful and the fabric is used is so soft. i wore them to the beach and they were very comfortable for walking around in all day. my only concern was that the shorts run large in my opinion. they have a tie string, which ended up working out, but i was hoping it would fit more like the model. i am 5' 4'' with a 24-25'' waist and ordered an xs. i usually wear petites, but i have bought xs shorts in regular sizes and they have always fit. i do still recommend these shorts, as th",4,09/11/2018
Love this top!,"This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4"", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!",5,19/06/2018
Great staple!,"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)",5,02/12/2018
Great staple!,"I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium. i probably could have gone with a small, but given that i am a 34d on top (and @ a size 2 on the bottom & @ 120lbs), the medium fits me just fine. it is super soft, and you can wear it with just about anything. keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are. however, i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt (so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time",5,23/04/2018
Substantial!,I love this sweatshirt! i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect. the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closet...and it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroidery...funny how 2 pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li,5,31/07/2018
"Beautiful, unique jacket","I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe",5,29/11/2018
Treasure,"This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to",5,10/11/2018
Not as pictured,"The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.",1,10/09/2018
You don't know what you get until you get them...,"Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful, but it also stops the material from stretching, so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also, they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger",3,21/02/2018
Amazing unique,"I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool. 
they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.",5,25/05/2018
Unique jeans,"I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit, but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing, but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha",5,24/05/2018
Perhaps the most comfy pants ever,"I'm 5'2 & the length is fine except i'd probably hem if i used for yoga/pilates. but i prefer cropped for those activities, so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me. they are thin, but not in a cheap way. i don't understand why they're called french terry became that's not what i see/feel; but they are sumptuous & soft. i like that the fold over waist part is stitched & keeps its shape. for size reference, , i got the black xxs- i'm 115 lbs, athletic apple & they fit/look great & clin",5,20/06/2018
Was very excited about this dress,"This dress is just my style. i have been waiting for it to go on sale since it hit new arrivals. when the sale hit the extra 30% off, i pulled the trigger. unfortunately for me, it was a little snug in the bust and as a tall lady, the waist hit me at slightly the wrong spot. i am 5' 9"" and am a 36d. so if you are tall and busty, this will not be the dress for you just from the way it is cut and manufactured. the skirt section of the dress has a hook underneath the vest section that it is pretty",4,10/11/2018
Nice quality,"This dress runs tts. the fabric is a good quality, and it has pockets. i am about 5'5"", and it hit just above the knee. i really wanted to keep it, but it hit me at an odd spot and not on my waistline. this made the dress look awkwardly full and me look hippy (despite the fact that my waist is 26"" and my hips are 35"").",4,15/07/2018
L space estella bottom,"I wear a 25/26 jean and the size s in this bikini bottom was just too small. in photos it looks so cute, but on me it just didn't look like anything special. hopefully the larger size has more pizzazz.",4,07/09/2018
Great lounge wear,Excellent dress for lounging in the house or for sleeping. very comfortable and a little sexy at the same time.,5,18/04/2018
Great basic!,The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,5,12/07/2018
Great casual henley,"I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!",5,10/07/2018
So soft!,"This is one of the softest shirts ever! i agree with another reviewer about the shirt not worth the original price but once this shirt hit the sale item, totally worth it.",4,02/06/2018

Wonderful work to dinner dress,"Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea",5,03/09/2018
Very nice skirt but too small,I would have liked it but it was too small for me.,4,05/10/2018
Not as it seems,"I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.",1,20/05/2018
Absolutely gorgeous,"This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5"" and the dress is a perfect l",5,08/07/2018
Beautiful and unusual,"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",5,29/07/2018
Flapper-esque,Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,5,01/08/2018
Lovely but the cut/sizing is not good,"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",2,07/07/2018
Frompy,"I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress...",1,15/09/2018
Spectacular!,"This skirt is gorgeous. i'm glad i saw it in-store as the picture online does not do it justice. the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental, vintage feeling. it also has pockets and a great, glamorous swing to it. this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a t-shirt tucked in and sandals. the fabric has a really nice four season weight, i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn. i get so many compliments",5,03/08/2018
"It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering","It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.",2,07/02/2018
"Gorgeous lace top, design fail","I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking, especially the lace portion. 
it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail, it balloons up right below the bust, making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise. 
i ordered size s, the smallest available, and it fit very wide more like a",3,19/05/2018
Fly away sides,I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.,2,03/04/2018
Pretty bad in real life,"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo",1,24/09/2018

Swingy and light,"Swing dresses are the holy grail of comfort. whatever's going on underneath doesn't matter because you're all arms and legs and billowy fun and this dress doesn't disappoint. beautiful, light and silky fabric with a pattern and color palate that can easily work all spring, summer and into the fall with some layers. a great, unique dress!",4,05/05/2018
Swing into spring!,"This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!",5,18/09/2018
Cheaply made,"I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.",1,15/06/2018
Flower sack,"This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.",2,03/10/2018
A-mazing!!!!!,"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!",5,26/10/2018
So pretty,"I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling",5,09/06/2018
Odd cut,"I order from retailer regularly and am pretty consistently a 0 petite or xxs petite. i ordered this in a 0 petite and it was like 5 inches too small in the rib cage and chest area. even if i would have got it zipped up, the halter cut is cut narrow so you can't wear a bra for sure...strapless would be necessary. also, the actual neck part was tight. for reference, i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and a 32c bust. it seems you need to be flat chested to pull this one off and maybe missing a few ribs.",3,08/09/2018
Ok,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful, but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single, good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.",3,31/05/2018
Even more beautiful in person!,"This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3"" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up. 
overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i",5,09/07/2018
Bummer,"My first complaint is, this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way), you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top, or the fabr",3,07/09/2018
Great flowy dress to combat the summer heat!,"I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.",5,07/11/2018
Pretty but small,"Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.",5,22/04/2018
Flirty with an odd fit,"This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7"", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!",4,20/06/2018
Good not great,"This is a cute top. not perfectly made, a little boxy, but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.",4,07/07/2018

Better than i'd hoped,"I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab",5,22/02/2018

Beautiful short!,"These shorts were just what i expected from retailer. they are more pretty in person, particularly for the color - like a rich clay color, not garish orange. very good quality fabric & the embroidery around the edges is unique. i'm usually a size small in bottoms from retailer & the s fits perfectly.",5,30/03/2018
So cute but not a great fit,"I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me, which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back, in side two layers, and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.

Very comfy- dress up or down,"Tried these on several times in store and never bought them, but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable, perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!",4,18/08/2018
New favorite shorts,These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.,5,05/05/2018
Ahahahaha,"This was so ridiculous on me. i'm 5'8"" 120 usually a 2/xs. so i ordered the xs. the inseam of the shorts are so short they barely cover my bum. and i mean barely. the romper itself was so wide that two of me could have fit in it.  love the colors, fabric, and the non-elasticized waist. if you are under 5'5"" this might work for you in non-petite sizing.",3,25/06/2018
All in ones are tricky,I really like this romper and i ordered it to fit my bottom. i'm a 6 on the bottom and 4 up top. i ordered a mp to cover the bottom and a petite for my height. it's a keeper but i will be belting or adding something to cinch it at the waist so that it has more of a shape.,4,29/01/2018
Weird fit,"I am 5' 7"" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute, you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material, but extremely awkward fit.",1,30/08/2018

Skort fans rejoice,"I'm a huge skort fan from way back, but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack, so when i saw this on line i was excited, and when i saw it in the store, my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish, functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft, so it hangs in a flattering manner, instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea",5,25/02/2018

"Long on me, but i loooove it","I am short so this ends up being really long on me, but i like that i can show off some amazing heels with this skirt. lately, i have been getting into grey so that it puts more attention on my accessories. the cut of this skirt is amazing, and the thick waistband is non-traditional which makes something that normally would be boring, really stand out (plus it helps hide baby fat!). the fabric is a medium weight, but it does flow nicely, and it does not seem to wrinkle easily which is a huge plu",5,16/04/2018

Romper rules,Overall great romper! i have a long torso and thicker legs so i sized up to a small and i am very happy i did. the shorts are a bit on the shorter side and go upon the sides so another reason to consider sizing up. the quality is great and super soft chambray with a trendy tie up.,4,10/05/2018
Perfect summer maxi!,"Maxi dresses are always my summer staple and moss has been my favorite wardrobe color lately, so this dress was a must buy! i'm petite and this came about two inches above my feet. i would be cautious if you're more chesty, i wear a c cup and typically am a 0/2 at retailer, but the extra small's bust line didn't hit under my bust properly and was too high up. i'm hoping sizing up will fix the problem if the small comes back in stock online. besides sizing issues on my part this dress was nice and",4,20/08/2018

Perfect for summer nights!,"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle",5,05/03/2018

Love,These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didn't cut in my sides.,5,29/09/2018
Better than expected!,"I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste, but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami, but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets, so i'm not terribly concerned.",4,31/07/2018
"Lovely material, a miss otherwise","I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately, that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist, causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly, couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.",2,04/09/2018
Short shorts!,"I am 5'0"" tall and i have decent legs. these shorts are pretty short! i am sending them back for a small to see if they'll give a little more coverage. i should mention that they are absolutely darling and i bought the top that is shown with them. it's going to be a great little summer outfit. the quality of this brand is always very good.",4,15/07/2018
Interesting fit,"I really looked forward to receiving this piece, it was however extremely difficult to get on and off. you have to step into it and it is very narrow. it is difficult to get your arms in and i had to have my husband's help getting it off. i am 5'9"" 135 pounds. i have a fit figure. i ordered a medium, i wear a small or x-small for a top and an 8 in shorts or pants. once it was on i was not thrilled with the extra material around the hips and tummy area. it is not terribly becoming, it bunches up",4,26/04/2018
Birthday gift,"I purchased for my daughter who is mid 30's and she loved the romper.
i'm going to list her size since that is appropriate for who is wearing the item.",4,12/10/2018
Nope.,"The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. 

also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.

i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.",1,29/01/2018
Least flattering romper ever,"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",1,19/02/2018
Just what i wanted,"Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!",5,21/08/2018
Nice flow,"I think 4-5"" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs, but still feel comfortable running errands, and these fit the bill. they are short, but they are loose, the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice, wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day, wore them 2 days in a row, all day, everywhere, got lots of compliments, comfortable, washed and air dried, ready to go again. i am typically a 12, ordered the large, could probably",5,28/05/2018
Nice cami with cute detail,"I love camisoles like this, and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length, so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted, but not tight.",5,19/09/2018
Lovely but...,I have been staring at these shorts since they first appeared and finally decided to treat myself to them for my birthday. when they came in the mail i was so excited and they in person are even more beautiful and well made then in the picture. but be warned these shorts are rather short so if you don't mind showing a bit of leg these will be right up your alley.,4,27/04/2018
Favorite shorts,"I absolutely love these shorts. i do, however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24, 25, 0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available, but that was not an option. they are a little baggy, but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on.",5,06/07/2018
Love and hate,"I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down.",4,10/08/2018
Gorgeous and socially conscious,"I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close, and i realized it was better than i thought. however, i didn't have time to try it on.

it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und",5,03/09/2018
Petite please,"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth, not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns, you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs, so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai",3,02/03/2018
Adorable,"Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.",5,24/09/2018
Adorable and comfy,"These are so comfortable, it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.",5,08/11/2018
Modern comfort,This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,5,06/12/2018
Beautiful dress,This dress is much larger in person than it looks on the model but i absolutley love it! there is an inner tie that helps taper the waist a bit and the material is gorgeous!,5,19/07/2018
Fine on sale,Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.,3,24/08/2018
Not worth the price but looks good!,"I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress, but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality, a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.",3,18/03/2018
Awesome beach dress/coverup,"Just received this dress today. i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico. i wanted a nice coverup.
this is beautiful. fits nicely without looking like a tent.
i would highly recommend. 
this is one size fits all.",5,08/06/2018
Boys and arrows high-neck top,"I love boys and arrows, but this top is really best suited to smaller size chests because there's no adjustable ties or straps or reinforcements for support. also, the fabric is super soft, which is great for feel but not so much for fit if you require a little boost! for my 32d's i chose a different design.",4,07/11/2018
Boys and arrows bottom,"Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long.",5,24/04/2018
Fits well and good for relaxing,"I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.",5,14/09/2018
Not what i expected,"This romper was not what i expected when i originally purchased. it is much more casual looking in person, and as soon as i got it out of the bag, one of the buttons fell off. it did look good on and fit well, but i will be returning because it is too casual for the occasion i bought it for.",3,12/03/2018
Amoret romper,"Adorable, comfortable piece. runs slightly big.",4,22/06/2018
Cute but not sewn well,"I too, was dubious about the dry clean only label but purchased it anyway because it was really cute and comfortable.  the shorts part is lined which is nice.  not see through.  the waist is a smocking with elastic.  it's also very thin thread.  the first one i tried on had a couple of stitches ripped in this waistband and because of that the fabric sort of bubbled out.  i bought a different one knowing it was delicate.  this isn't a romper your going to want to shimmy over your hips because of",3,23/09/2018
Great for tall frames!,"The style and material are nice, but what i love is that it does not give me a wedgie! and i think it would still fold nicely on shorter frames.",4,30/07/2018
Fun!,"Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.",5,27/05/2018
Finally a romper for all body types,I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,5,27/10/2018
Gorgeous shorts,"These shorts are just beautiful. with that said, they were expensive, but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large, and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!",3,06/08/2018
Pricey for shorts but like,"I tried these on as i needed bottoms to try on some tops (and i was wearing a dress), but ended up liking them. the fit is snug but comfortable, they didn't ride up and the denim is supple. color is nice too, looked really nice with a swing tank that i half tucked. i have muscular thighs, so shorts are not an easy thing for me... anyway, recommend (tried on 25: 115 lbs, 26-27 inch waist)",4,12/05/2018
Love these! exactly what i was looking for,I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!,5,21/02/2018
I love stevie everything,Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short,5,01/12/2018
Cute shorts for the length,"Hard to find longer shorts that i like. these are really cute. i thought from the pictures that the backside would be faded and lighter which i wasn't thrilled about, but willing to order and give a try. great to discover this is not the case- nice regular color on back and no fading. really cute shorts.",5,06/08/2018
Size up!!,"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..",5,21/02/2018
Fit was disappointing,"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs, curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on, they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite, curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area.",3,08/03/2018
Great shorts!,"I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt.",5,04/04/2018
Awkward on top,"Wanted to love this.. love rompers, but the opening between your chest was oddly designed, it was gapping and certainly couldn't bend over without showing lots.. fabric seemed heavy for the summer. all in all it was too full, made me feel frumpy..",3,17/06/2018
This is my new summer go to!,"This jumper is so cute, it is soft, and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going.",5,24/02/2018
Cute romper,This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.,5,09/06/2018
Great little slip or even summer dress,"Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.",5,20/07/2018
Perfect white tank,"I took this in a large. im a 36d 140lbs. this top in a large fit me perfectly without a bra. slightly see through but not by much... i haven't tried it with a bra on yet, but im sure it'll be just fine.",4,18/02/2018
Birds of paradise!,"I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.

the birds of paradise are just lovely, not exactly the same on every suit, but still nice. i just",3,24/02/2018
Flattering romper,"Rompers are usually tough for me. i am petite, especially on top (5'2"", 110 lbs, 34a), but have a healthy butt and hips, which can make sizing difficult. in this romper, i tried a regular xs, and found the fit very flattering. the top was blouse-y on me, but not overly so, and the arm holes didn't gape, which is usually an issue for me with non-petite sizing. the elastic waistband is also great, as you can adjust it to hit you in a flattering spot and keep the shorts from being too short (which",4,10/07/2018
Love this romper!,"This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 135 lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!",5,08/02/2018
Way cute,Nicely designed romper with an wide elastic waist band that can be worn on the hips or around the waist. not too short for this 60+ body and very comfy. i wear either a med. or large and went with large for this. a good buy.,4,21/04/2018
In love again,Tried this little number on in store...... i am 51 years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!,5,03/03/2018
Hot summer night outfit,"I'm 5'0 125 lbs and the petite small fits perfectly. i love the length of the shorts, not too short and not frumpy either. the waist has a hidden band so it hugs you in a good way and makes the top half slightly blousy, so it's forgiving. will go great with gray booties, black wedges or sandals.",5,10/03/2018
Really nice piece of work!,"I love this romper. it's really flattering and well made. at most stores, i wear a medium but normally at retailer i wear a small. i had to exchange the small for a medium, but other than i really loved it!",5,26/04/2018
Amazing,I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!,5,04/10/2018
Very cute!,"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect, not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!",5,19/04/2018
Love it,"Very comfortable, looks good on. like the fabric also.",5,05/02/2018
Great,Bought these a week ago at full price to take on vacation. love them i see they are now 1/2 price if they came in a different color would get a second pair,5,15/10/2018
Love this romper,"I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer. 

i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it.",5,26/09/2018
Has potentail,"I was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture. the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking. i'm 5'9"", 32c and i wear 28 size pants, usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one. i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big. i probably could have gone down a size but i wasn't loving it enough to try. the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp",3,07/06/2018

Lovely fabric and style,"....but not for me. i usually try to buy petite sizes since i am only 5ft 0in, but this was just too pretty to pass up so i took a chance and ordered a regular size xs. right out of the bag, i was impressed with the colors and fabric of this romper. however, i did not notice that the entire back was open until i put it on. from the pictures, it looks like there is a small opening, but when i put it on i was exposed all the way down to my lower back. this may not be the same for a taller person s",4,23/08/2018
Love this airy top,"This top is light and airy, but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big, but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.",5,22/06/2018
Runs large,"I wanted to love this. the fabric and design are very nice. unfortunately - on my petite frame it looked like a lampshade. this would be very pretty on taller girls. for reference, i am 5'3 117 34b.",3,05/05/2018

the fabric is light - but it's perfect for the summer",5,20/11/2018
Disco-ball-summer-cover!,"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty, feminine, happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos, but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts, everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics.",5,29/11/2018
Wow!!!,"I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders, and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however, it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed, and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest), and as i head",5,30/07/2018
Love!love!love this suit,"I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit, the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest, which i do (32g), this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit, though i would go a size up if you have a lar",5,25/03/2018
Sleek and well made,"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.

Runs about 2 sizes too small,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!,3,11/03/2018
Runs 1-2 sizes too small,"I am 5'7"", approx. 135 lbs, 27-28 in jeans, size 4 in dresses. purchased these in a size 8. i would suggest sizing up between one to two sizes. as a result, the upper thigh portion of the shorts do appear a little baggier - plus pleats - can be overwhelming in terms of material - but not so baggy that it would make it ""circus tent""-like. do not expect these to be fitted.definitely a fun pair of shorts. seems like it will go well with sandals, espadrilles, wedges. paired with either a front-tucke",4,06/03/2018
Size up!,"I followed the advice of the other reviewer and went 2 sizes up, i'm so glad that i did. i'm usually an 8 and i ordered a 12 and they are just right. the pleats made them very flowy in the hip, so it gives a little wider look on me than i really want, but i really love these shorts, so it's not a deal breaker. overall, i am happy with them, but definitely size up!",4,25/07/2018
Comically bad,"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. 

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good. 

they're also really tight compar",2,01/02/2018
Super cute and super small,"I adore eva franco but these are just not thoughtfully designed regarding fit. i wear a size 12 and took the risk of ordering the 12 as a popback, but they do fit 1-2 sizes small. i could get them zipped but it's not a good look. i feel like the waist would fit if the rise weren't so short. for reference, i have a 33"" waist and 42"" hips.",3,13/02/2018

Drop-dead gorgeous,"When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6, 5'8"" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!",5,23/09/2018
Beautiful on!,"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow",5,27/04/2018
Elegant boho chic!,"I am 5'1"" and 120lb with curves and muscles. i am tiny and slim but i have t & a in spades, a 34c and a bubble but. that said. this dress made me look tall and lithe. i took the xs petite because the xs the fringe was too long on the bottom. there is plenty of blouse on the top to accommodate the ""girls"" and you can pull the dress up or down to make it more blousy or more of a fitted column dress, to your preference. it's more of an antique ivory color and beautiful with gold or silver sandals.",5,11/10/2018
Cool dress!,"This dress is so unique, and is high quality. it came nicely packaged, and unfolded with no wrinkles. i bought it as a cool summer dress for events, and it fits the bill. i wore it once, and received many compliments. the only issue, is that you cannot take even medium size steps wearing this dress. a side slit would have solved the problem, but that would not have deterred me from buying it. the straps for the slip underneath are great, so that i could adjust it so my bra would not show.",4,06/02/2018
"Should carry xl, so here's what i did...","I automatically knocked off one star because every brand that offers size xs (and many also offer xxs), should also care about us size 14/16/xls as well. i ordered a size large, and of course it shows every bump and love handle in back, but i recreated a look from my local retailer's window. they showed a long unbuttoned cotton weave dress over this crochet dress.

Great goddess,"I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life",5,03/08/2018
Uniquely beautiful & elegant dress,"This is truly a beautiful dress! the delicate fringe-like fabric throughout makes it unique and and the column silhouette with slight blouse-like top is elegant! perfect for summer with comfortable stretchy slip that comes with the dress! the material on the waist line stretches and is very comfortable. the bottom is pretty narrow so you need to take smaller steps. it does run large, i am 5'3""/135lbs/34b and an xs fit perfect throughout as well as the length! only not so positive feature is how",4,03/06/2018

Stunning!,"Oh how i love this dress! i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric, it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers. it fits like a dream...true to size...romantic and flirty...i can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandals...the possibilities are limitless. i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out. just love it! i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket. it is a winter whit",5,24/09/2018
Perfect cami,"I originally ordered the white in this cami, but after receiving was absolutely obsessed with it! i ordered the 2 other colors. the fabric is so soft and the buttons are perfect as i just had a baby and will need easy access for nursing. love this cami!",5,21/03/2018
Cute summer top,Love this top! it's very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank. love it!,5,26/02/2018
So cute!,"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!",5,19/06/2018
Good summer top,"Fits nicely, casual and lightweight for the summer and i like the look of the cross straps in the back. no complaints!",4,16/10/2018
Pretty summer top,"This is a really soft, nice, summery top. i love the criss-cross detail on the back, as well as the button down. it fits looser around the stomach, but not in a trash-baggy way. 

it mostly fits true to size; the only issue is that the top button doesn't leave a whole lot of room if you have boobs at all. i wear a 34b -- pretty normal, not large -- and usually wear a small. i've found that the top button buttons fine, and looks good when i'm not moving, but it pulls a little when i move around",4,23/07/2018
Wanted to love...but,Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,2,09/08/2018
Great versatile tank,"Fits well, super soft and very flattering. great for layering and for dressing up or down. highly recommend!",5,10/07/2018
Fabric pulls very easily!,I bought these shorts last week in the cobalt blue color. they are super comfy and the color is beautiful however after wearing them for only a few hours i noticed a pull in the fabric that all the way down the front of the right leg. i'm extremely upset about this because they were relatively expensive for lounge shorts. i love the shorts otherwise.,3,16/08/2018
Great shorts,"I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale, and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice, and you can dress them up or down.",5,17/06/2018
Cute and comfy,"Flattering fit and design, but the material is thin and they are semi-sheer. great for lounging and the beach! very comfy!",4,30/01/2018
Wanted to love it,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.,2,11/07/2018
"Vintage beauty, but runs short","This suit is super cute! i think it will be too short in the body for taller girls. i am 5'4 117 pounds 32c and bought the medium. very cute fit, but it's almost slightly too short in the body. maybe if you are smaller on top, you will get more length in the body? i really want to keep this suit. i might consider the large, but the rest of the suit fits perfect.",4,03/10/2018
Meh... not doing it for me,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.,3,09/11/2018
Good short,I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.,4,30/04/2018
Gorgeous suit but only for the right body type,"I absolutely love this suit and was very disappointed to have to return it! it is really well made and the fabric colors/design is beautiful in person. unfortunately it just did not fit my body type. i am athletic build with a smaller chest and thicker behind, 120lbs, 5'4. the small was definitely the right size for me, but the back of the suit cut way high up on the butt so that a lot of the rear is exposed, which just did not work well for me. this will work great for someone with a smaller bu",4,05/09/2018
Cute cover-up or summer top & shorts!,"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",5,28/08/2018
"Felt short, and i'm short","I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic, she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top, but if you stand upright, it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m",3,10/08/2018
Perfection,"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!",5,18/02/2018
New summer staple,"This is so pretty for summer. it is very lightweight and flattering on. the color was a little brighter than i expected, but it is still beautiful!",5,09/05/2018
Beautiful chemise,"This is a very soft and feminine chemise. it is a little more see thru than i had anticipated, but i still love it!",4,03/03/2018
Great beach shorts,"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",5,20/04/2018
Cute cover-up or summer top & shorts!,"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",5,27/10/2018
Great casual dress to throw on,"I ordered a petite medium in black, and it fit great great. some of the other reviews said it was tight, but i found it pretty loose and flowy. also felt it was plenty of coverage - wore it to work (casual workplace) and transitioned to happy hour beautifully.",4,12/04/2018
Lounging dress,"This is a great lounging dress or a great beach cover up. i ordered up a size after reading other reviews. although, i feel like my normal size would have been fine probably. i ordered the black and it is not see through. it's very light weight and comfortable. i may even order in another color just because it's so great to wear around the house.",4,22/03/2018
Functional casual dress,"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks.",5,06/12/2018
Overpriced but so comfortable,This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.,4,23/01/2018
Luxurious sleepwear,"This is a very comfortable and sexy sleep dress, the way it drapes. i can see that the type of fabric is not suitable for out and about activities and can catch on snags, etc. very easily. once i relegated it to the nightgown category it became my favorite item to wear and lounge in.",4,22/10/2018
Comfy and cute,I love this dress for day and night time. the back detail is cute and works well with a racerback bra. it runs big though. i'm normally a small in dresses and the arm holes are too big in the size small on me. it was also generally too big all over. i like the length and the weight of the fabric. i purchased in the off black color.,4,11/09/2018
Super comfy,"I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!",5,05/07/2018
Beach cover-up,"I got this to wear as a beach cover-up over bathing suits. if you purchased a darker color and were small chested (i.e., you could go braless, since a bra won't work well with the low back and armholes), you might be able to pull this off as a very casual dress. i bought this in a xs in the coral/peach (i'm 5'7"", 129 lbs., 32dd) and it's not super see-through, but i'd never be comfortable wearing it as a dress on its own. as a beach cover-up it's cute and comfortable, but as a dress it would be",4,20/06/2018
"Loungewear, not outdoor wear","So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",2,21/10/2018
Easy breezy,"This dress is the best casual find. goes with everything- flips flops, tennys, jean jacket. feels little sporty and the orange was a cool addition to my closet.",4,24/03/2018
Great price for,"Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a ""i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice"" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up.",5,07/07/2018
Can't wear a bra and it is see through,This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.,1,29/01/2018
See through,I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.,3,31/01/2018
Slouchy,"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.",2,07/10/2018
Striped tank dress,"Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.",2,01/10/2018
Very sheer and see through,"I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable, but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it, but i'm not sure what would work based on the style, and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.",2,10/02/2018
See through,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,1,26/10/2018
Cute cover up,"I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft, very good quality, fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!",5,14/05/2018
Very cute style,"This dress has really great features--the style is adorable, and i love the color. the contrasting color straps are a nice feature. the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a rather thin material. not quite sure yet if i should wear it as a dress or simply as a swim cover-up.",4,15/05/2018
Great swim cover or pj dress,"I bought this for a swim suit cover up and i'm very happy with it. the fabric is thin and rather sheer, i wouldn't buy it to wear it outside as a regular dress. i'm 5'6"" and the front of the dress hits me above the knees. the fabric is soft and comfy. the blue with white piping is pretty and the fit is flattering. i'm really happy with this dress.",4,11/03/2018
Bathing suit coverup or pjs,"I agree with other reviewers that the material is pretty thin, and it would make a far better swimsuit cover-up or pajamas than an actual dress -- unless you don't mind that it is semi see-thru. however, that said, i do love it! it is soft, the cut on top is nice and the strappy back is pretty, and it is flattering -- as long as your tummy is fairly flat because it does hug your body as you move (so no bread and pasta). i have worn it a couple of times already, and i have received compliments on",4,27/02/2018
Disappointing quality,"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",2,28/08/2018
Crossback day dress,"Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin, so it works as a swim cover, but definitely not a dress for anything else.",3,05/09/2018
Cute socks,Fun socks you will want to show off. design is printed on a relatively thin (trouser sock).,4,09/09/2018
Siamese cat pattern,"For cat lovers in particular, these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.",5,27/02/2018
Pricey,"This dress is only suitable for a beach cover-up: it is completely sheer. expensive, even on sale, for something with such a limited wearability. i returned it.",3,22/07/2018
Beautiful dress but it runs very large,"I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.",2,07/12/2018
Beautiful gauzy cover-up/dress,"I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is ""diaphanous,"" but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit",5,30/08/2018
Great for beach & summer holidays,I'm glad i tried this on in the store because it runs very large. i usually wear a large and i ended up buying a small. the blue color is very striking. i plan to use it as a cover up and sightseeing dress this summer.,4,06/11/2018
Just hangs there,"I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted ""just another cover-up"". in the final analysis, even at $35 (30% off 49.99), it just hung there. if that's what you're after, then this is for you.",3,13/07/2018
Gorgeous,"This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.",5,05/08/2018
Perfect summer dress,"The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!",5,07/07/2018
Just okay,"I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9"" tall), 32d chest. i liked it, it was comfortable, but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end, i d",4,13/02/2018
"Lovely dress, but runs huge!","The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous, but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small, which is unreal, since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite, height-wise, but more than length, there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely, though, so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!",4,01/04/2018
Pretty cover up,Ordered this cover up in a mp but it was waaay too big so now waiting for the sp to arrive! hope its a hit!,4,05/05/2018
Comfort and style in one pant!,"Love the fit....not so tight you can wear a short top with these, but not slouchy either. color goes with everything. for wrinkles, i hung them and sprayed with water...wrinkles gone. bought 2 pair for traveling.",5,08/05/2018
Just awesome,These joggers are amazing! they fit true to size if not a bit loose. i purchased my usual small (size 6). the seams are sewn perfectly and the fabric is dreamy. i wore these to work with sandals and was so comfy and appropriate all day in the hot weather. the color is a deep gray and goes with everything! the front panel makes them a bit more fitted and there is even back pockets!,5,15/03/2018
Throw on and go,"Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days.",5,18/05/2018

Way too much fabric,"I wanted to love this jumpsuit. it looks adorable in the product photo. i am 5'5"" about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me. i tried everything--- pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line, wearing a variety of heel heights----i couldn't seem to make it work. there was just so much fabric on me! it felt like i was wearing pajamas (and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out' way). i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut. on me, this jumpsuit was just",2,11/09/2018

Pilled immediately,"The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.",1,27/11/2018
Perfect layering piece,I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!,5,06/12/2018
Staple cami,This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.,5,10/03/2018
Fabulous tank,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,5,11/11/2018

"Easy, comfy & cute","I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6"" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s",5,25/05/2018

Stunning,"These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs.",5,13/05/2018

Runs small and short waisted,"I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown, but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere, which just seems wrong in this style pant. also, take note, these are slit up the side, which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit, but still, does c",3,02/05/2018

Terrible all around,"These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...",2,17/11/2018

"Cute, poorly made","Love the fit of this top, love the design. it does fit a bit small which was a pleasant surprise considering the sizes don't go as small as i usually have to. i got the smallest size and its pretty tight. its a revealing/low cut top, which is great for minimal tan lines. negative- threads are coming out all over after one wear. but i love it so much i will probably order again once it falls apart.. not so great considering the price though.",4,23/11/2018
Love them!,"They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection, due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality, the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.",5,26/10/2018
Like them.....but.....,"I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online, but when i received mine, they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange, then more orange!!! i like orange, but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not, mostly orange on both front legs, the back of the legs have more color blocking, but barely any of the light lavender color",3,12/05/2018
"Nice, but not quite as pictured","These are nice, flattering bra with light to medium suport. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra. exmaple: on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange. on the bra i received the left side is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right side is orange and light purple. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block shorts as we",4,12/06/2018
Easy breezy,"This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.",5,03/11/2018
Love! my new favorite swimsuit!,"This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!

for reference, i am a 34a, and purchased a small.",5,09/02/2018
Glad to find a swimsuit with full coverage,"Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind, and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings, so that may be uncomfortable for some, but i found no problem with it. for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants, and i purchased a medium.",5,18/05/2018
I'm wearing it as a top!,"I bought this in the store so i didn't know that it was actually a sleep chemise. i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a super-short dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on. the price is shocking but i'm a teacher and this month (july) teachers get 15% off so that helped a little bit. when i tried it on, i absolutely loved it. maybe i look like a cupcake but i'm a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves! who doesn't love tassels?! this is just a ve",5,05/11/2018
Beautiful yet runs large,"I really loved the material and the feel of this item, however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.",4,27/10/2018
Runs way too big,I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,1,30/11/2018
Stunning!,"I am beyond pleased with this dress. photos do not do it justice and no, it does not look like a gown. it is comfortable, forgiving, and will be a staple for years to come. i am 5' 11"" and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size. this is my first maxi dress and i'm thrilled. do not miss this piece, it is special!",5,12/03/2018
Lovely dress,I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,5,12/03/2018
Perfect with 1 alteration!,"The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!

wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels.",5,06/07/2018
Gorgeous in person,"The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it, and a slip dress underneath. this way, the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture, or left ope",5,20/04/2018
Meh,"This dress looked great on the hanger, but once on, it did absolutely nothing for me.

navy is one of my most flattering colors, but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.

i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses, but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher",2,05/07/2018
Better as a dress,"This lounge robe is the most fantastic, dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd and 140#.",5,29/10/2018
Cute dress,"Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.",5,02/11/2018
Cute tunic,This is a great cover-up or tunic over leggings or capris. i am 5 foot two and it comes to my knee,4,28/07/2018
The material is lightweight and comfortable.,The only draw back are the slits on the side. they are too high and if you turn sideways at some angles you can see your cheeks. i will have them sewn up a bit because i love the dress and it is worth it.,4,16/09/2018
Good if you're taller,"I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered, but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good, but the back just looked like a big oversized, stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall, go for it!!",2,08/10/2018
Perfect summer dress,"Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.",5,19/10/2018

Love this,This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.,5,14/08/2018
Pretty standard,"It's cute. it works with jeans, linen pants, flip flops. but i wouldn't say it is a ""must have"". but i'm keeping it because it works!",4,24/05/2018
Tunic for everything,"I bought this tunic to wear as a swim cover-up, last minute. but it has become my go to for wearing over skinny jeans. the length makes it so versatile, great layering piece.",4,02/04/2018
Sliced tunic dress,"I already have this in white. i wear it all the time and get tons of compliments because it's so unusual. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because my white one is a large petite and this one was not available in petite (i bought a m). i'm 5'2"", 135lbs and am a little thick in the middle so the large petite gave me that extra room. this material is stretchy though so i am able to kind of pull on the sides to widen it a bit. i put it in the dryer and it shrunk a little in length too. th",4,25/06/2018
Casual & cute,"I am happy with my decision to buy this dress! it's casual, comfortable and my favorite color, too. this product is true to size, color and the material feels great.",5,07/08/2018
Great weekend and casual dress,"I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors",5,22/07/2018
Just as i expected,"When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.",5,26/07/2018
"Could be a cover up, dress, top over jeans","This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over. 
i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.",5,06/12/2018
Ok,"This dress is more of a lounge dress for at home even a belt and nice shoes would. it make it ok for day. 5$2 back is way longer than the front, more so than shown in the picture and the material is not substantial but for a lounge dress or swim
coverup it is fine.",4,04/06/2018
Very cute & comfy!,"This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large, i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference, i'm 5'7'', 125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.",4,30/10/2018
The entire set is so cute!!!,"I got the shirt, the cami, and the shorts and they are all great. super comfortable fabric, really well made, and really cute. love them all!",5,30/03/2018

Cute and comfortable,Very comfortable to sleep in. doesn't bunch up or twist. love this.,5,06/07/2018
Runs big,"This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.",5,16/08/2018
Soft!,"I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors. it is soft can be worn both ways, and i like the crisscross detail. very comfortable, not formfitting.   i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small.",5,04/06/2018
Amazing casul top,I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!,5,18/02/2018
"Loose, flowy top",Very flattering cut.  very loose & flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.,5,10/07/2018
Cute two way top!,"This top is adorable. i love it! i couldn't figure out which way to wear it so i just wear it both ways.the tag is on the side, which allows you to wear it either way. it does run big! i normally wear a medium and i could have used a small, but kept the medium because i like very loose clothing.",4,28/02/2018
This is a great casual shirt,This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.,5,27/09/2018
Pretty but cheap,"These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way",1,11/05/2018
Fun,These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.,5,01/08/2018
Beautiful fabric and style,"I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend. they were so comfortable and flattering, friends told me i could wear them out for dinner.

the fabric is beautiful, and i loved the way they draped. the angled cut on the legs is very cute, and something a bit different. these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner, because the fabric is very light and breezy. dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and you're good to go.",4,18/06/2018

Fun,These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.,5,31/05/2018
Cute !,"These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.",5,18/04/2018
Too cute!,"I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can. the fish print is adorable! and you can't beat the style and uniqueness for this price. i am 5'6"", 145 lbs with long legs and a thicker waist. normally wear size 8 in pants and purchased these in size small. i would definitely recommend sizing down. the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow. can't wait to wear these!!",5,26/09/2018
Flattering & versatile,"Love this product; got them in the coral and they are comfortable, easy, flattering & versatile.
dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!",5,07/11/2018
"Such a fun,casual and comfy item","I bought this in a medium at the store (usually a size 8 -10) and bought one for my daughter who was with me ,in the coral color. (she's 7 months pregnant , and bought her a small. it fits fine below the belly. she loves how comfy it is.) my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well. :>) so, we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in. i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well. i did see that a",5,12/03/2018
Perfect for the beach or pool,"I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative.",5,20/08/2018
Adorable,Loved these beach pants! i purchased the size medium in the coral. i loved the accents on the ties and the little pom pom details. i did get many compliments on them. the only thing i don't love about them is the material is very thin. i know they are beach pants but i personally would have liked slightly more weight to them. i wore them once with a pair of cropped leggings underneath and i thought it was a very cute way to wear them with some additional substance underneath.,4,05/12/2018
Super cute pants!,"These are adorable pants!!! i ordered them in both colors because i couldn't decide which was cuter. they are light and airy, but not see through. they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup, pajamas, dress them up, anything. very comfortable and versatile! i am a size 8 and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. the elastic doesn't pinch, but probably would have if i would have went with a small.",5,20/08/2018

Comfy,These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.,5,26/01/2018
Maybe....,"I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.

i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p",3,09/06/2018
So cute!,"These are *almost* perfect. the fabric feels great, and it's a super cute print. the only downside is that the rise is really long and high. i wish they'd stocked more petities, because the petites are all sold out, and only the super long regulars are left at this time. if you are above 5'7"", they'll be awesome on you. if you are below 5'4"", you may be getting them altered.",4,26/03/2018
So cute!,"These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.",5,18/10/2018

The summer skort,Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,5,11/06/2018
Adorable and unique,A scandalous mini skirt that isn't a skirt! beautiful pattern. does run a little big.,4,16/05/2018
Awesome printed skort,"Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please,  cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!",5,30/05/2018
"Pretty dress, horrible quality","I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color, the fabric, and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.
now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a",3,21/06/2018

the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!

heads turned as i walked by!",5,07/04/2018
Gorgeous... try it,"I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight (feels delicate) and to the floor. fell in love with the watercolor print. this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini. beware- if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach, make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super see-thru, which is my least favorite part of this piece. i couldn't get to the petites sizes before they all sold out, so i'm crossing my fingers th",5,07/05/2018
Beautiful pants!,I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.,5,20/11/2018

Sexy and comfy,"This robe is exactly what i was looking for.  it's perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off.  it is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but that's fine for me.  only downside is that it has to be hand washed.",5,01/12/2018
Just what i was looking for!,"This is the perfect lounge/sleep cami! i am 5'1'' 120 lbs and purchased the dark purple small. it's hangs a bit loose - my preferred fit for sleeping shirts. good quality, easy washing (machine/delicate), and cool and airy for hot summer nights.",5,29/07/2018

Good purchase,These leggings are very comfortable and cute. only reason they are not 5 stars is because the pattern is not quite as vibrant as i was expecting.,4,05/10/2018
Pretty,"I have admired the workout leggings retailer sells since they debuted last year and i was excited when these went sale-on-sale. they're very cute and definitely true to size. i was worried the white made me look big, but with a longish shirt it's fine. also, they aren't made from the most athletic fabric - i think if i sweat in them too much they'd get icky fast. i don't sweat that crazy from my legs though so i expect they'll be fine!",4,07/12/2018
Summer blossom crops,"In the photo i loved the colors. in person though, the print on mine had the four huge pink lily flowers on the front and it just wasn't the look i was hoping for, like the photo. also, i failed to notice in the photo that there's elastic along the seam of the butt! this seems silly and unnecessary.... it's not terribly noticeable on, but still i felt weird. the fabric is thick and not see-thru and the quality is fine, but the combination for the shifted print and the unexpected ruching and thes",4,15/02/2018
Quirky,They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.,5,25/08/2018

Tx fan,"I love the flower patterns. they add feminine touch. this legging is well made with good quality spandex. the only cons is the color is not as deep as the picture. when you wearing it and the fabric stretched, the color looks much lighter. other than that, it's a good buy!",4,28/06/2018
Awkward fit,I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.,2,27/09/2018
Very pretty,"The design is gorgeous and the fabric feels great. not a lot of functionality, then again i did buy the kimono to feel sexy and not to keep warm! i ordered the xsmall/small and feel i should have ordered the med/large. unless you're super tiny/fit, i'd recommend sizing up here. i bet it would still be super flattering a touch larger!",4,08/12/2018

Falls flat,"Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans",3,01/04/2018
Love this dress!,"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",5,22/06/2018
So flattering!,"I love these cozy, fashionable leggings. they are super flattering and thick enough to wear to yoga or out and about in the real world. i will definitely be getting another pair! they seem true to size. i am tall (5'11) and usually wear a lg.",5,29/10/2018
Well-made but lacks structure,I love the style of this swimsuit on the model. when i purchased is i didn't realize that there was no support (wire/ padding/ lining) in the chest. the rest of the swimsuit was great but i did not like the look in the chest - it provided no support. i ended up returning it.,3,27/01/2018
Love this romper,"I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts, it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg, something like a 4"" inseam on a short. on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect. still stylish and still ""short"" for summer without it being so short on the bottom. well made! nice closure at bust so there is no gaping.",5,10/06/2018
Perfectly sexy and sweet,"My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.",5,13/05/2018
Exceeded my expectations,"This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! 
it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.",5,24/01/2018
Great fit,This romper was cute and short but not too short. the fabric is soft and elegant.,4,08/06/2018
So cute!,"This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on, an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.",5,23/04/2018
Very comfortable with super pretty embroidery!,"Love this romper! very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour, it's not sheer and undergarments won't show through. a forgiving fit for everyone",5,12/11/2018
Adorable but overpriced,"The print of this dress is what enticed me, and it did not disappoint. the fabric is a nice shade of medium grey with cream printing. however, the fabric is very thin. thankfully the top part is lined, but the bottom is not and it should be. this lightweight dress great for hot summer days, but for the price it really should be lined on the bottom as well. 
the dress is more a-line than pictured, which i liked. the bust is fitted and there is elastic in back. the skirt is fairly loose and flare",4,24/10/2018
Easy-fitting dress for casual summer days,"I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too.",5,29/10/2018
Love this dress!,"I really love the fit of this dress. i said it runs true to size, and it really does--even with the stretch fabric around the back and adjustable straps, i would not recommend sizing down as i normally do at retailer--there is no stretch to the actual fabric on the dress. i'd never bought anything by this brand before, and i would say that the fabric is quite thin for the price of the dress, and it is not lined (i'm still hoping it's not see through). however, for me, the style makes up for",4,30/04/2018
Nope,I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.,1,03/08/2018
My favorite workout leggings,"These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.",5,13/09/2018
Excellent fit and style,These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.,5,20/04/2018
"Great leggings, but may not be for petites.","I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.",5,18/08/2018
Substantial leggings,"Wasn't sure about sizing so i ordered the xl and they fit my 5'3"", 153 lb frame. they'd work for any height because they gathered quite a bit around my ankles but easily adjusted to look like they fit. amazingly, they don't show the squishy bits at all. it's a substantial thick knit. i'm returning because i don't have the body for these and i'm short waisted so the top, wide, slenderizing part of the waistband starts well above the area where i carry my weight in my tummy, mid section. i highly",4,07/08/2018
The best leggings,"Super comfortable while also being very flattering. i'm 5'7, 135 lbs and ordered a size small which fits perfectly. i get lots of complements on the color, which is as pictured. love these for yoga, climbing, and lounging.",5,15/05/2018
Very light and lovely,"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. 
note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).",5,19/02/2018
Soft and cozy,"I sized up to an xl and although they have everything you want in a yoga/lounge pant, they just didn't thrill me enough to keep them. they're soft, warm and comfy but i didn't care for the bulk or fit of the foldover waistband. and they were too long so i returned. if you're built like the model, you'll love these.",4,05/07/2018
Love,"Gorgeous wide leg sweats. i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum. they don't seem like they will last long because they are thin. but the cut is adorable and very flattering. they were a gift, not sure i would have spent $78 but i do love them.",5,29/01/2018
You will live in these pants!,"$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b",5,19/02/2018
What i expected,"Beautiful fit, love the style!  fabric somewhat thin, but didn't bother me. thought a little expensive however, but i'm keeping!",4,13/05/2018
"Excellent style, poor quality control","I practically live in lounge pants, and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well, if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband, and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown, definitely not",3,07/12/2018
Great slip but runs small,"This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said, great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.",5,14/08/2018
Great fit,This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out,5,07/07/2018
So comfy,"Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7"" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!",5,10/10/2018
Cute lil romper,"This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!",5,27/11/2018
Love this!,"This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual, and probably best used as a beach cover up, as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said, i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing, i usually order a small, and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.",5,03/04/2018
Comfort and style,The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,5,20/10/2018
Comfortable,"This will be my third pair of hei hei shorts.  i was very pleased with the previous two shorts, sand city short and dobby beach comber.  all shorts have nice materials and not too tight, perfect for the summer.  i typically wear s or m depending with the material and design.  i bought size s and it fits nicely.",4,23/10/2018
Yes!,"Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.
i am very happy with this purchase.",5,20/09/2018
Fun & easy shorts!,"Really cute and comfortable. i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments! worth every penny, and now they are on sale!",5,12/07/2018
Adorable shorts,"These shorts are great for warm weather. they look great with a navy top. the pattern is very attractive. they are on the baggy side, but the style is very flattering.",5,15/08/2018
"Nice material , but runs large","This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big, so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!",3,15/06/2018
Nice summer dress,"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",5,30/11/2018
Beautiful flowy vacation dress,"The pattern on this dress is even more beautiful in person. as reviewers mention, the dress is sheer, but a nude slip underneath is an easy fix. can't wait to pack this dress for my next beach getaway!",4,29/07/2018
The jury is still out on this one...,"Really pretty for summer, especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top, so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on, and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it, since it's really pretty for a summer party.",4,19/10/2018
So pretty,"This dress is so vibrant in person. i am 5'10"" and the length is perfect. having a small waist helps too. certainly worth the $49 i spent on it. watch the sales. several times ill go to pay for an item, and its even cheaper that advertised. the uniqueness that retailer embodies is what i love the most about their clothing. i'm a size 10, ordered a medium",4,28/09/2018
"So pretty, but so sheer","The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up, but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine), but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely, unique beach dress, this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!",4,05/10/2018
Beautiful!!,"This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!",5,15/09/2018
Beautiful fabric design,"It runs long for a 5'1"" woman like me:) other than that beautiful dress for vacation",4,28/10/2018
Love it more than i thought,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.,5,13/03/2018
"Definitely beautiful, definitely sheer","I gave only 4 stars because i really wish the fabric was not so sheer. unless you are very unmodest, you will need to wear a slip. 
i am 6 feet and it hits just above my ankle. slits on side and front. i know it is 'supposed to' be use as a beach cover-up..but forgot that! this is way too pretty not to wear out at night(with a slip {:>). 
i am not a fan of the tie waist, so i at wear a belt to cover it. 
overall, i recommend. enjoy!",4,12/09/2018
"Lovely on the model, but not for me","I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.",1,28/08/2018
Beautiful,"This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.",5,23/03/2018
Cute casual summer dress,"Just purchased this- love how light and airy it is. perfect for throwing on on a warm summer day. it is soft and comfy, but it does run pretty large. i am normally a m, and in this the m was swimming on me. i purchased the s, and still loose and flowy. i wore a strapless bra with it, but will also try a bandeau or tank top.",4,06/03/2018
Pretty but runs big!!,"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.
style is fun and flir",5,06/02/2018
Fun easy dress!,"This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl",5,26/04/2018
Lovely chemise fabric!,Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!,5,26/03/2018
Sweet stripes,"I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it's flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning.",5,09/09/2018
Dreamy cozy pants,These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.,5,08/03/2018
Looks better on the model,"I wanted to give this a try but unfortunately disappointed with the fit and styling. i'm 5'6"", petite build and it consumed my slim figure. i loved the soft and coziness and the color is sweet too. i just felt like an awkward butterfly with the sleeves. pinning them back would have been alright but the execution didn't fit my frame. i would have liked it to be a tad longer too. i really hope they use this same material throughout the fall season because it's so cozy.",3,18/09/2018
Cute slip but very body hugging,"Ordered this in white. it is really nice and sexy but very body hugging and unforgiving. perhaps it is my large stomach, but it hugs a bit too much for my liking. yet i think overall the design is very nice so i am keeping it and hoping i can lose some weight in my tum.",4,06/09/2018
Completely see through,"I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks, but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok, but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker, this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this, i wouldn't recommend.",3,06/08/2018
Love,"I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter, super soft, true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras, i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6', 144lb, slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!",5,06/09/2018
Love!,So great! soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body.,5,14/07/2018
Yoga vest,"I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large, and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?",3,09/05/2018
Love them,Bought a pair of these with a gift card i got for my birthday.  just ordered another pair!  i love them for everyday use and working out,5,13/10/2018
Great bikini top,I love the design of this top.  the pattern is beautiful and the back unique.   i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage.  i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure.  i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.,5,26/05/2018
Cute and comfy,Great swim top. good coverage and very comfortable. be advised this is not reversible like title suggests.,5,03/06/2018
"More ""cheeky"" than expected","Cute print on both sides, but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy, but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top, so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it.",3,03/08/2018
Cute & comfy,"Very sweet color , will go with everything . soft material . generously sized but cut is meant to be comfy .",4,25/07/2018
Unique little socks,Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!,4,10/07/2018
Beautiful as a nightgown or dress!,"Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did, it is lovely! i can't wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"", i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)",5,29/10/2018
Comfy and cute,"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on, i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin, but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it, it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase, and i can't wear it as a chemise, a coverup, or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!",5,02/09/2018
Why rayon?,"Usually i'd wait for a sale on rayon loungewear but i would have gladly paid more if this was cotton or silk! despite the poor fabric, the design is light and beautiful with a high quality floral print that's distinctive and elegant. i can wear this with a thin strappy slip or a lacy cami bra or with a cardigan, jacket and lacy boy shorts. an retailer employee wore this chemise under a denim shirtdress and belted the whole outfit together--it was perfection. i purchased size m and my figure is 39-",4,05/08/2018
"Elegant, comfortable chemise","I love pj's and other assorted lounging pieces, and this one is exceptional. in fact, i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store, and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.
the fit is tts. fyi: 36c, short waist, broad shoulders, 5'3""
i normally wear a m/l in a chemise, and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room, but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves, without showing bumps",5,08/03/2018
Beautiful but sheer,These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids,3,09/09/2018
Skimpy,"I love the look of this bra, but unfortunately it is pretty skimpy and sheer. i need a little more padding to define my shape and i wish it had modesty padding. this wasn't for me so i returned it.",4,18/05/2018
Fits fine - fabric/color not terrific,"I ordered this in black and white, thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles. 

i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory, not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality, however the fit is good, and true to size.",3,27/09/2018
Nice camisole,"I purchased this in the black and received it today.  it is silky feeling and is a quality camisole.  the color is a muted black, not all shiny as some silks are (and they often look cheap) but this looks great and could be worn alone, under leather, or with a sweater/kimono.  i usually wear a medium in tops, and this fit true to size.  i am 5'2"" and it doesn't look too long, but i do wish it came in a petite.  still keeping it!",4,22/02/2018
"Gorgeous, high quality, and figure flattering!","This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! 
i'm 5'2"", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. 

the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online. 
the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc",5,17/09/2018
Casual and smart enough for work,"I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. 
this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.
i can definitely see getting a lot of wear",5,21/04/2018
Good work dress,"I came to retailer just to browse and came across this dress. i almost didn't get it because it looked very big. however, i tried it on, and fell in love with it. it does run a little wide, but the length is good, and it is very comfortable. it is perfect for the summer months.",4,15/09/2018
Gorgeous and versatile,"Just received this in black and am in love! it has a stevie nicks vibe and i look forward to wearing it as a swimsuit cover up, dress with black slip underneath, and even with a black tank and skinny jeans! it really is beautiful. i am 5'3 and was worried it would be too long, but it just hits above ground with flats, and will work even better with wedges.

it is big and will flatter a variety of sizes... even though i'm a 6/8 i don't feel like it's too overwhelming.

my only concern is how",4,09/08/2018
Runs very small,"I usually wear a size 2-4, and ordered a 4 here. it was way too small. it seems like a nice suit, so i'm ordering a size 6 and 8 to try. but definitely heed the warnings and order at least one size up.",4,21/11/2018
Beautiful timeless basic,Gorgeous suit! one of the most well made suits i've ever owned. sexy yet provides great coverage. do note the sizing is per australian standards. i had to order a size up.,5,30/10/2018
Nice pants but size down,"So hard to guess fit and size so because i carry my weight in my tummy i ordered an xl. they were too big. the waistband is a nice, very wide, comfy elastic but fit loose. the legs were a bit baggy too and too long for my frame. the fabric is soft and has a bit of a contrast down the sides of the leg. due to the length, i decided not to reorder a smaller size. i think you'd be safe to size down in these.",4,25/01/2018
Very comfy,"These are a bit oversized, order a size down. they are a nice weight and look great under tunics.",4,20/07/2018
Beautiful chemise!,"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!",5,25/07/2018
The softest leggings,These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.,5,22/05/2018
Love!!,"I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!",5,03/10/2018
Finally found nice leggings!,I am a curvy woman and leggings are new to my world. i am sorry that i did not discover these leggings sooner because they are lovely. they are comfortable and cozy with a great fit. i am 150 lbs and 5'7 and the m/l fit perfectly. i have the black and plum colors. great purchase!,4,28/05/2018
Super soft and comfortable,There's are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough.,5,19/05/2018
Lovely fabric but tiny hips,"If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.",3,14/06/2018
Gorgeous but bra runs small,"Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker, i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences, and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty, and this one fits, it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind, the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie,",5,21/08/2018
Beautiful,"I've never worn a romper before but decided to give this one a try because i'm loving the colors/pattern. i'm so glad i did! it's even cuter on and very flattering! my only complaint is the buttons. i wish it was easier to remove and put on especially since this is a romper afterall. still, this is a beautiful piece!",5,13/02/2018
Fabric great - difficult to put on,"I know rompers typically aren&amp;#39;t the easiest and while i loved this fabric this was a pain to put on no zipper, etc. and the buttons are tiny and since the fabric doesnt stretch it is difficult to even try on. the length of the shorts was great and the fit was just ok all in all i don&amp;#39;t think it is worth the price.",3,24/04/2018
Perfect for a socal thanksgiving,Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.,5,30/09/2018
Perfect little affordable dress,This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,5,04/10/2018
So close...,"I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small, rather, i believe, they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging, but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless, i won't be wearing these!",3,24/11/2018
All day whenever possible,"My daughter loves these, she wears them around the house all day when she doesn't have to go out.",4,08/08/2018
Great pajama pants,I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.,5,19/06/2018
Comfy but put together.,"Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!",5,18/09/2018
Soft and super comfy,"This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft, comfortably loose, but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!",5,30/03/2018
Classic with a twist,"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.",5,28/01/2018
Perfect summer to fall transition piece!,"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however, the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!",5,18/02/2018
I love this jumpsuit,"I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3, 122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;)",5,17/03/2018
Really disappointed,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer, please get the fit right!!",1,29/08/2018
Dress me up or down!,"Love the color of this shirt! i wear it under a brown leather jacket i purchased, in store!",5,23/09/2018

Very pretty,"True to size, very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.",5,03/06/2018
Nice in between seasons top,"Great top for in between seasons. comfy/soft/roomy. fyi - the pattern has tiny holes that will show through - i.e., bra, skin, etc.",4,30/06/2018
Light weight & sheer/ great for layering,Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,5,11/10/2018
Love love love this!,I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :),5,22/05/2018
This dress looks much better in person!,"I recently bought this dress in an retailer store, to attend an art museum event,. the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem, which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa (the same brand and print as the dress.) the dress is described as casual, but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals.

Are you kidding?,"Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight, i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely, so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.",3,03/07/2018
Not for the price,Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.,3,11/10/2018
Surprise,I'd hoped these would be cozy and warm. the fabric is thin and slinky. it grabs and emphasizes every bump and roll. couldn't wait to get them off. just horrible. and that price is very steep. can't recommend.,3,17/09/2018
Runs big,"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",5,16/05/2018
Love these pants!,Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!,5,28/06/2018

A little short but...,"I'm 5'4"" and weight 130 and i usually wear a small in dresses from retailer. although this fits everywhere, it's a tad shorter than i expected based on the fact i figured the model was at least 5/7"" and this looks to be mid-thigh.. it's mid-thigh on me so i'll be wearing tights and boots- can't wear without tights...imho. otherwise, so comfortable and cute...",4,05/03/2018
Comfy casual dress,"I bought this to wear to work, but i pictured it as being fancier than it is. the fabric is heavy, stiff sweatshirt material. i bought a small but probably would have been better off with an xs. despite this, it's long enough to be a dress on me, and it is comfortable and cute. it will be nice in the winter and could probably be dressed up some.",4,13/06/2018
Maybe for some...,"I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.

first, it is way too short for me, especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay, to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also, the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th",3,02/02/2018

Online way different from in person,This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,1,08/05/2018
"Comfortable cute, very casual dress","This is made of soft, sweatshirt material. it is one of those dresses that you can put on with sandals or birkinstocks and go out to breakfast or throw it on to go to the beach or wear after yoga. this is not a ""dressy"" dress. that said, i love it. i used to have a sweatshirt dress from another brand that i wore out and have been searching for the replacement. this color is a pale celadon, a tad bit more vibrant than the photo, which makes it more flattering than you may think. i wear a 4-6 and",4,23/05/2018

Cute and comfy but too young for me,"I grabbed this on a lark because it look like a fun little ""throw on"" dress. it's a very lightweight sweatshirt material and fun and a fun flouncy design. run a bit large and regular sizing was still above my knees. if i were 30 years younger, i may have bought it just for lounging, but the over sized ruffly sleeves made me feel just a bit too silly and the color is pretty washed out. not for me, but cute for teens and early 20's.",4,22/11/2018
"Casual,, chic and comfortable",This dress is sweatshirt material and a lovely soft grey aqua color. i purchased a medium and it is an inch above my knee...ii am so tired of seeing woman my age and much younger in jeans...i am wearing this to a cooking class and it is perfect because it is so comfortable.....it is a great replacement for jeans!!!!!!!,4,15/09/2018
Cute and comfortable,"This is such a good dress to just throw on and go! the inside is lined with fleece so it's basically a giant sweatshirt. it does run large. i normally wear a medium and i bought the small but could have bought the xs if the difference in length between the two hadn't been about a foot. (i am tall). the color is actually a light mint, not the grayish blue it appears in the picture. overall a great purchase though.",5,03/04/2018
Not enough style,I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.,3,16/05/2018
"A shirt, not a dress","Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4"". needs to be about 6"" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.",1,04/03/2018
Horrible!,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures, no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",1,15/08/2018
Don't size up,This top is oversized. i normally wear large but thought an xl would be best for sleeping. it's huge. so stick with your normal size or a size down. pretty print. fabric is a bit coarse. undecided about trying a size down because i'm particular and they didn't wow me. also ordered these in the lighter color and they fit the same.,3,17/08/2018

Unusual and eyecatching,"These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.",5,01/03/2018

"Beautiful print, so comfy!",Love these - the colors are perfect for fall. originally ordered a small which fit fine (i'm a 6-8) but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasn't as stretched - i'm glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason.,5,06/12/2018

Yes yes yes,"This top immediately caught my eye in the store.  not only that, it was the pink color and i don't usually gravitate towards pink.  i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round.  i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later.  you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy.",5,27/11/2018
Almost good,"I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink, but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large, hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle, but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.",3,09/03/2018
Great fit casual wear,"These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.",5,30/11/2018

"Shoulders are off, bad pleat placement",Overall the top is cute . what doesn't show in the photo are the pleats on the shoulder/neck area. the placement of the pleats makes you look like you have a football player neck . the neck area doesn't lay flat but comes off as puffy at your neck. i've never seen pleats placed in such a spot. ruined an otherwise cute top,3,05/07/2018
"Beautiful top, shorter than expected","I love this top! i've already worn it 3 times since getting it about 2 weeks ago. it is beautiful and has a lovely, subtle pattern to the fabric that i didn't initially see in the photo, but then did and still wanted it. it has a nice drape and is comfortable and flattering. my only critique is that it comes up a little shorter on my torso than i expected. i am a medium/size 8 with 34d bust and the top comes to maybe 2 inches below my belly button. i think it's still flattering and comfortable,",4,15/03/2018

Not what i expected,"I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much, right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl, having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life",2,03/07/2018

Wide and long,"Been on the hunt for jammie's so gave these a shot. ordered my normal size large. fit well in the waist but i don't like the super wide legs. and they're too long. pretty color and pattern, however, the fabric isn't as soft or cozy as i hoped. i'm retired and wanted pajamas to lounge in all day. these missed the mark for me.",4,13/04/2018
"Lovely, but not one size fits all.","I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support, it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said, selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading, at best.  i'm 5'2, ~160 (a lot of it muscle, but i enjoy chorizo), a 34ddd, and this fit me perfectly, but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium.

Nice tunic but runs small,"I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l, usually wear l/xl, i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much, i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back, but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up, it runs too small.",4,03/04/2018
One the fence,"I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose, and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price, i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.",3,25/11/2018

Great racerback!,I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate,5,04/09/2018
Light and breezy,"I bought this in my usual size small.  it is really light and airy--very pretty.  as the other reviewer noted, it is longer in front and shorter in the back.  the back hit my waistband, as it does on the model in the picture.  it hid my bra very well (always a plus).  i wouldn't describe the fabric as soft and i did get a static electricity issue, but the top stayed put.  overall, very pleased.",4,18/08/2018

Sleek and unique but not sure . . .,I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.,4,05/03/2018
"Interesting color, thin material","I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4, 155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me, with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person, like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer, so you would need to wear a slip, and the elastic waist still has somewhat of",3,02/12/2018

Pretty sloft and silky,"I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky, i love the back, how it ties, and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go, just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...

Sheet,"Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5""130lbs  and 32dd.",3,29/04/2018
Runs big,"I ordered size large and find it too boxy and long. love the hem, although the top is too long in this size so it's a bit hard to judge how it'll look in the right size. the sleeves are cute and different, a bit wide and flowing. be warned, it's sheer which is more apparent from the side view. i could clearly see the garment cleaning instruction tag through the bottom side hem. has potential but not enough for me to reorder in a smaller size.",4,14/07/2018
"Pretty color, but wrong fit","I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however, like the other reviewer, when i tried it on, the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.",3,19/05/2018
Forget about wearing a bra,"I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus, it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!",2,13/04/2018
Great top!,I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.,5,05/07/2018
Gorgeous green color,Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,5,23/11/2018
Sunday tunic,I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!,5,01/04/2018
"White tee with a ""detail""on back",I ordered a small. i'm usually a petite small. i like my tees not fitted. i will exchange it for an xs. soft. it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back. i barely noticed it. i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique. good quality. 100 percent cotton. it's a white tee. soft.,5,28/02/2018
Perfect pant,"Comfortable, flattering, one step up in formality from jammies, what more could you want?",5,30/07/2018
Runs small,This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,5,24/09/2018
Great basic!,"I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it's a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!",5,22/07/2018
Sizing runs very large,"I am petite and ordered size small, and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice, but in terms of the waist and length size, both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all, and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item, unfortunately.",1,14/09/2018
Cute and comfy,Really love it - soft and nice quality - only complaint is the straps are too long for a normal sized torso. the front drapes below my breasts at the tightest /smallest setting.,4,23/03/2018
Runs very small,"Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.",1,04/08/2018
Pretty,"This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.",5,02/03/2018
"Adorable top, a little pricey","I ordered this shirt to wear with a pair of pants that i had to return - which is one reason the top went back as well. it really is cute and i like the exaggerated key hole in the back. i certainly could have found other things to pair with this top, but it came down to the price. i just didn't think it said $118. hopefully its still around when it goes on sale. its very cute. fits true to size.",4,05/05/2018
Such a beautiful victorian blouse!,"I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something",5,26/03/2018
Super cute,"I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless.",5,26/02/2018
Ig brought me here,"Love the way this top layers under my jackets and sweaters! so romantic and pretty. i am not experiencing the over pouf at the waist that a previous reviewer complained about. the fabric is slightly itchy and the top shipped to my house has misshapen shoulder bumps from the store hanger. all the beautiful styling pics done by retailer employees on ig is what made me want this blouse. whatever is going on with the model shot really really really does not represent how cute this top looks. in fact,",4,19/10/2018
Wanted to love her,Beautiful victorian look blouse. runs large and overly blousy on me.,3,23/07/2018
Victorian in a good way,"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin",5,16/05/2018
Different but nice,"This top was different than what i normally wear but based on good reviews i purchased. i really love it. it is different than i thought it would be. i thought it was longer sleeves but it is just above the elbow. definitely need a tank or something underneath as it is see through and the sleeve holes are quite large. 
definitely recommend.",4,28/01/2018
Beautiful!,"I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it ""might"" be sort of cute. a comfy, flowy, warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room, including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store, and it still looked great! it is comfortable, loose, and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr",5,25/05/2018
No go,"Ordered navy in a medium and it is wide. sometimes that's a good thing, but not this time. am short waisted and hoped this would be more fitted at the waist on me but it isn't. it just looked frumpy with lots of see through parts. obviously it needs a cami but wasn't attractive on me at all. seemed well made and probably better on someone taller.",3,20/07/2018
I'm a lil disappointed,"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it, just a bit disappointed.",3,20/08/2018
This top is beautiful,"The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.",5,13/10/2018
So lovely i bought two?????,"This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5"",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make",5,23/09/2018
It's huge!,This is a beautiful blouse but it's gigantic. my bra size is 34d and i was swimming in a 2. the bust measured 42 inches at it's widest point. you can see the model is camouflaging the volume by holding her arms to the side. the fabric is pulled in an unatural way so the top is probably pinned for the photo. if you want this look go down 2 sizes. that much fabric is just not flattering on me so i am returning to the store. i'm passing on the 0 because the thin fabric seems like it will seriously,4,12/03/2018
Truly outstanding,"I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!

the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. 

the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're",5,15/07/2018
Just meh...,"I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore",5,26/09/2018
Disappointed,I had such high hopes for this top. it is beautiful but it is very uncomfortable! the lace/beadwork is extremely itchy. the button at the neck seems cheap and i was worried it would fall off. the beadwork and lace puckered on my shoulders making the fit off for me.,3,21/08/2018
Lovely!,"This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!",5,30/04/2018
Beautiful,I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!,5,25/05/2018
Great top,"I love this top, the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned, but might if i wore it to work",5,02/10/2018
Love the top!,"Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.",5,04/12/2018
Swing away,"A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places, no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size, you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.",5,13/03/2018
How beautiful is that!,"This is a treasure and ""must buy"", friends! tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts, and i feel stoked to have gotten this one. the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and well-designed. i've always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small, but, when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large, i am sooooo satisfied. this sartorial work of art is completely lovely! i have a busty f",5,07/11/2018
Pretty back,"Like the previous reviewer, the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12, which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4, this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else, though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.",3,21/05/2018
So feminine!,"I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra.",5,18/03/2018
Awesome print but horrible fit!,"I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.",1,17/07/2018
Unique,"This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.",5,23/07/2018
Complete all on it's own,"Cute, simple top that completes an outfit all on it's own. it is pricey but i finally took the plunge and bought it.",4,01/05/2018
Not for every body shape,"This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size, the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went, sadly.",3,24/05/2018
Wardrobe must,The online pic does not even do this beautiful blouse justice. in person it is stunning and goes with everything.,5,01/06/2018
Nice details on this fun and flowy flamingo top,I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.,5,03/07/2018
Definitely try on before buying,"Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small, especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest, just weird look on me. unfortunate, because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.",3,18/10/2018
Love it!,"Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!",5,16/04/2018
So soft and beautiful,This top runs a tad big. it's beautiful in person and sooooo soft. definitely an retailer staple top. material and cut is great,5,13/08/2018
"Beautiful, feminine top!","I really love this top! it is soft, lightweight, and really pretty. it has quickly become one of my favorites!",5,02/09/2018
Weird boxy fit,"The lace on this top is pretty, and i liked the way it was styled in the product photos, but did nothing for me on. between the loose sleeves and the boxy cut of the front, it just sort of hung shapelessly on me. i also found the back to be much shorter than 30.5""--it came to a few inches below my hips and was not tunic length like i expected. the shoulders fit me well, and because the top was boxy already, i didn't want to size up for length. for reference i tried on xs (i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",3,26/05/2018
"Beautiful, but awkward fit and not worth the price","I love the lacey design of this top. however, it is very wide and doesn't fit well on someone with a small frame. i tried ordering a petit size. the width was better, but this size was too short. in addition, the lace didn't lay very flat, and there were lose threads all over. overall, not worth the price.",3,25/05/2018
Underwhelmed,"I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped, i pounced on the black. sadly, it did nothing for me. i'm a large, sometimes medium, but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price, but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back, uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.",3,11/03/2018
Beautiful!,I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.,5,24/11/2018
Love!,"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",5,20/05/2018
"Very pretty, but . . .","This blouse is very pretty, but the overlap in the front is a little ""strange."" it seems to fall open and will require either a pretty pin to hold it closed or a cami underneath. despite that ""flaw"" i am glad that i purchased this blouse. the trim at the shoulders gives it a romantic and special appeal.",4,11/06/2018
So cute but buttons pop off,"Love this blouse, however upon every time i wear it, a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!",3,23/04/2018
"Casual, fun use of plaid","The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.",5,05/09/2018
Poor quality,"Great looking shirt that i bought for my wife, but poor quality. the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off. first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off. when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug. its really too bad because it looks great otherwise.",3,30/09/2018
Great shirt,I love an all cotton shirt! feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top,5,07/04/2018
A mixed review,"The positive: light-weight fabric, interesting drape

the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.",3,17/10/2018
Party in plaid,"This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.",5,14/05/2018
Soft and flattering!,"This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app",5,02/02/2018
Beautiful details!,"I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!",5,27/11/2018
Super gorgeous!,"The quality of this top is quite high. it feels like silk. the print is lovely, showy without being too over the top. i love it and would highly recommend it.",5,27/04/2018
Amazing top!,This shirt is amazing. the pictures on the model do not do the shirt justice! the shirt is a bit longer in person than shown on the model. the colors are also more vibrant. the material is so soft and has great flow. i am excited to dress it up for work with a pencil skirt and have the option to wear with skinnies and a cute sandal on my off days.,5,29/08/2018
Cute but billowy,"This is an eye-catching top and cute design. the xs fit but was extra-billowy for my taste...if you notice on the model it also shows that the back is not fitted and flows behind wider than is normal...a great and breezy style, but for me, sadly it overwhelmed my short frame. the bottom of the ruffle hit me just at the hips which made the top also a tad too short for my taste. i am sure on others it will work and look amazing.",4,04/07/2018
"Incredibly soft, great print","I just got this top today. the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web. it is so incredibly soft and comfortable. i tried it on and it fits just like the photo. i am 5'8 so i can get away with the blousy effect, but, i think that is part of why it is so charming. i think you could dress it up or down really well. i am really pleased.",5,15/11/2018
Buy this top!!!,"Love this top. the material is light, soft and comfortable. one thing to note. it runs very large? this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middle?this style would not look good if it didn't fit loose?..so i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of room?.something i need for my full figure. if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two.",5,25/06/2018

Little pricey,It lays very nicely on your body. very flattering!!!!,4,06/02/2018
Adorable!,"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large, but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"", 130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu",5,02/11/2018
Easy breezy and pretty!,"This is very comfortable, and pretty top. i love the pleated peplum and the flutter sleeves. the v-neck is the right height, and the embroidered polka-dots are very sweet. i got many complements wearing this perfect for summer top!",5,19/07/2018
Had such promise,"I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum, cap sleeves, and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately, this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition, the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower, too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.",2,05/03/2018
Great work blouse,"I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print.
based on the existing reviews, i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer, but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b.",4,05/02/2018
Disappointing blouse,"I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy, i didn't like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.",1,16/05/2018
"Lovely fabric, not boxy",I've bought similar blouses from retailer before that i didn't love as much as this. it's not boxy or wide on me. it's a great length and i find the 3/4 bell sleeves to be elegant. i bought the purple one on sale and went back for the red/cream. my only complaint would be that the stitching could be of better quality. the fabric is very nice -- love the print.,4,08/02/2018
Beautiful and versatile,"I bought this in the purple print. the fabric is soft - similar to silk. looks great with black, burgundy, tan pants/skirts. i find it comfortable and received compliments on it at work.i have not washed yet - cannot comment on washability..",5,25/04/2018
Boxy and runs huge,"I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern, when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale, which it definitely will be, but even then am not positive i would keep it.",2,27/03/2018
Cute but not cute enough,"This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.",1,18/10/2018
Not for everyone,"The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin, this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i, too, am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s",3,06/03/2018
Lovely color but flimsy!,"I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it, around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering, but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is, even with the tag sale. the color, pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one, but, as i sa",3,16/08/2018

Gaping,This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale,2,21/10/2018
Just didn't work for me,"This top does look as pictured, the sleeves hit me the same and the size was true... i just didn't like it... it was shorter than i wanted in length and i just didn't feel like this top was worth the price so it's going back. i feel like i have had shirts with this texture and over time, they just didn't wear as well so i was afraid with 3 kids it wouldn't be a good idea. i paired it with a blazer and it looked great, but on it's on, i don't know, just not for me. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lb",4,25/09/2018
Great top!,I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable.,5,26/03/2018
Chic top,The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.,4,31/03/2018
Beautiful detail,I love this top. it comes with its own camisole. the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect.,5,10/08/2018
Great top,Really love this top even more than i expected based on the picture. i have already worn it 6 times in a short period of time. it's been a great fall top,5,06/12/2018
"Beautiful, looks like just photo on....","I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change",5,27/08/2018
Weird shape,"The pattern is very adorable. unfortunately the design is flawed. sizing is great at the waist and hip, and the length is spot on, but the top is wide. it's strange because i don't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either.
will return. i'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it.",2,21/06/2018
If i had the right size...,"...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print, colors, and design. however, i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it, the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.",3,12/06/2018
Super cute,A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,5,31/03/2018
Cute but thin material,"Cute shirt with a few nice details: embroidery and tasseled tie in back. a little pricey in my view for what you get. nice, loose cut. true to size. cotton is very sheer. i'm well-stocked on white see-through shirts that require a cami, looking for one that doesn't need layering- returned for this reason.",4,28/03/2018
"I like the idea, but the execution wasn't so good","I think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i don't know how i would use this top. i don't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops (if people see my bra slightly so be it) but this is really sheer, unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this, and in my mind, that defeats the purpose of a lightweight, sleeveless top. i returned it and was sorry to have to do that.",3,30/04/2018
Cute top for summer,I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it. i love the tassel on the back at the tie. the fabric is not too sheer. the fit is loose and will be cool this summer.,5,13/07/2018
Two strikes,"Two strikes against this top, and its going back. first, the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact, since i have tanks i could have worn, but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price, i wouldn't have expected b",3,28/05/2018
Pretty colors,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,2,13/07/2018
"Very cute, fits nicely","Fabric is a little thinner than i expected, but just wore a camisole. the waist is a little short. nice batik-like pattern and feel.",4,29/09/2018
Runs large,"I so wanted to love this tank, and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model, but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it, but it just can't work on me!",2,08/03/2018
Completely sheer!,"Please be awate that although this blouse is beautiful and the color is gorgeous--it is completely sheer!!! it just doesn't match up with the price point,",3,25/01/2018
Classic shirt,I love this shirt and the colors it brings out. this shirt makes a great statement. it can be worn with jeans and look great or worn with slacks. i great a lot of compliments.,5,08/10/2018
Darling top,"I love this top! it's classic and classy but with a fun update being a henley. the gingham is super cute, the texture of the fabric is really nice and soft and thick (it is fully lined). i plan to layer it for winter and can't wait to pair it with white capris come spring. i bought my usual size xs and it's a little snug at the hips (where i'm more curvy) but perfect overall. highly recommend!",5,22/09/2018
Beautiful quality but runs quite small,I would say that this blouse runs 1-2 sizes too small. the fabric is unique - it's like gauze backed by fine netting - and the workmanship is excellent.,4,19/04/2018
Cute top,"Really cute top, normally order a s or xs. based on reviews, i ordered a m and good fit.",5,03/11/2018
"Beautiful fabric, huge cut","The fabric on this shirt was beautifully woven and so soft/cozy. but the shirt was so wide! i'm 5'2"", 103lbs and got an xs. there was room for two of me in there. it draped very well, but instead of looking slouchy and cool, it just looked too big. so, back it goes.",3,24/08/2018
Very lightweight comfy fabric,I love this shirt!!! i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general. i returned it for a small and it is perfect. size down! i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt.,5,09/09/2018
Summer blouse,"I am 5'8"", broad shoulders,can sometimes wear a size 4 depending on the cut. i purchased the size 6 and was a true fit. just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are. the fabric us light and great quality. perfect for a summer night out. so happy with this purchase",5,09/08/2018
Cheap fabric,"While i love the design and shape of this blouse, the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.",2,21/09/2018
Wow!,"Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all, but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a small, but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!",5,25/03/2018
Polka dots,"I thought this top had shimmery dots, that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived, it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.",3,02/09/2018
Great summer shirt,"I can tell this is will be a ""go to"" shirt this summer. simple lines, yet a little ""different"" style - soft stripes, slits on the side seams and short, but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans, dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts, but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape.",5,11/11/2018
Great shirt,"Love this shirt, the material the design... but....i have not worn it yet... the side openings are strategically placed to show my least flattening angles, if you know what i mean. i will be sewing these two openings and hope the shirt still looks and fits beautiful.",4,05/02/2018
Fab versitile top,"Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple, very wearable with pants, with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest, without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes, it is cropped...very much so!!! so, if",5,12/07/2018
So pretty,"This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.",5,30/08/2018
Disappointing blouse,"This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.",1,28/01/2018
Simple and pretty,"I love this blouse, it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans.
it is loose and flowy, the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top.
i happen to love the fabric, it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton.",5,03/08/2018
What a mess!,"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.

i'm busty, but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",1,22/05/2018
Runs small,"Normally wear a medium in most retailer tops (5'9"", 150lbs).  would probably need an xl to fit more like a tunic.  right now, in the medium, fits more like a tiny shirt, but more for fitting.  arms are also tighter than i expected.  will be returning.",4,08/09/2018
Tight sleeves,"I ordered this item when it was first advertised, fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed, the fabric is cheap, the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.",3,26/07/2018
Lovely flowing top with detail,"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",5,14/11/2018
Beautiful color and texture; fun shape,"This top is flowy and feminine. the pink is slightly more vivid than pictured online but is still a beautiful, soft pink (definitely not red). i was afraid the shape would be unflattering on my not-so-skinny figure but it's not. it's baggy all over, and there's plenty of room in the arms. note that dark pants/skirts will show through the fabric, so i like the shirt better with an untucked cami/tank top underneath it (so the gorgeous neckline isn't disturbed but the pink color runs true throughou",4,04/05/2018
Order down,"Cute shirt, it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!",5,08/08/2018
"Exactly as pictured, adorable spring top","Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it's a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material, the bell sleeves, the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder, due to the elastic neckline, but i prefer it on, as pictured on the model. 

the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro",5,03/07/2018
Perfect for fall layering,Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase,5,03/11/2018
Great top,"Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!",5,06/05/2018
Too boxy for petite frame,"This was a bit of a disappointment. the colors are beautiful, but the shape was not flattering on my petite frame. it is somewhat wide and boxy in the shoulders and body. the fabric is stiffer that i expected, and therefore it doesn't drape nicely on the shoulders and through the torso. if you look closely at the model, you can see what i am talking about at the shoulder. the shoulders stick out a tad, and the gathering at the neck contributes to the larger, boxy look. this might look nice on th",4,08/11/2018
Will be wearing this shirt all summer!,"After reading the other reviews, i took a chance and ordered the peach one and the blue (red?) one in large. i am usually at the top end of xl's, but i've noticed that holding horses items tend to run a bit bigger. i hit the jackpot with this one. yes, it's a little ""boxy"". all the better to hide what i want to hide. the length is perfect for me and the gathers at the shoulders give enough room across the chest so that it doesn't pull at the buttons. the peach one came today, and i was a bit sur",5,15/11/2018
Blousy back,"Beautiful crepey fabric, lovely color. i was surprised to see gold threading in the peach option; i'm not a big gold thread fan, but it's do-able. the ruching across the back makes the fit very loose and blousy. this is not a figure-defining piece. but it's comfortable (will probably be more so after a wash to get that stiffy factory fabric finish feeling out), and versatile.",4,21/02/2018
"Metallic gold in peach, not so apparent in photos","Bought peach online, but exchanged for other color. there is a metallic gold stripe that i didn't expect in peach option. i thought i would mention as it wasn't so apparent in photo. interestingly there is no metallic thread in the other color option.",4,16/07/2018
Gotta love lurex,"The 'peach' color is actually a lovely shade of rose and the smocked detailing at the shoulder is exquisite - but there are bold stripes of gold lurex running through the plaid. if you like that kind of thing, you'll love this blouse. it hangs well and is a substantial but airy fabric.",4,09/02/2018
Beware shrinkage!,"I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.",1,25/11/2018
A new favorite!,"This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7"" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh",5,15/06/2018
Runs large,"Pretty top. quality material, it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy, if you don't size down, the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.",4,06/10/2018
"Pretty, big, but for tanned people","This top was really cute on someone else, but not on me... on me, ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too, just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season, it is a bit boxy, but looks nice with jeans, white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...",3,10/09/2018
Great shirt!,"I love this shirt for a throw on and go.  hangs nicely and fits great.  colors are more vibrant in person.  i love mauve, i think they do a great job with their designs!",4,17/05/2018
"Made well, but not flattering","The top is made well and has a strap holder to keep your bra hidden which is always a nice feature. however the amount of fabric made it unflattering on me. the overall design is fun and i probably would have purchased if it had been more fitted and flattering. i have a medium on in the photo, my measurements are 38-30-40.",3,02/09/2018
Add me to the list,Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.,5,27/10/2018
"Big fan, but the snap is a little tricky.","This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.",5,13/06/2018
"Very cute, short","This is very cute in person. i love the colors, a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine, with the ruffles, but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me, i would have to wear with higher rise pants, or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy, so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list, didn't get it yet,...though the day it showed up at my loca",5,06/02/2018
Nice light weight top for summer!,"I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly, it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer, colors are brighter/better in person.",5,11/04/2018
Drive-in plaid tank,"I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short, even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad, because the shirt is cute.",3,21/11/2018
Confusing sizing,"I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6, 137lbs, 34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it, regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!",3,01/08/2018
Cute but gross polyester,"I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.",2,28/02/2018
Great addition to your spring/summer wardrobe,"I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top, faded, ripped, rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.",5,26/03/2018
Unique staple!,"I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it's light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesn't stick to other fabric. i wouldn't quite call it ""gauze"" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it's super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it's clean and classic. when worn open, it's cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish",5,24/02/2018
This top is great!,This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.,5,10/06/2018
Way cute!,"As in previous reviews, this top can be worn in many ways. it could even be used as a pretty bathing suit cover-up. i like it with my cropped cotton spandex leggings which i have in many solid colors. i plan to wear it unbuttoned with my classic style spandex tanks i have in various colors & prints. the complete look says 'summer' & feels cool & comfy in this warm weather. even hubby loves the look! 5'3"", 117#. i bought my usual size small.",5,19/11/2018
Love this top but be careful!,"I absolutely adore this tunic, however, i followed the label and hand washed/hung dry and it shrunk! i was able to exchange it, so i will be taking it to a dry cleaner to see how it needs to be cleaned.

"Huge, long, lightweight",Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.,1,30/06/2018
"Very thin fabric, pretty disappointing","I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy, soft cotton, but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath, which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra, but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra, which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to",2,22/07/2018
Great bouse,"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",5,31/03/2018
Gorgeous print,"It's the print that attracted me when i was in the store. it is beautiful, but i fear it demands darker skin and hair. if you have problems with yellow, then don't buy. i don't mind the transparency of the fabric because it is not noticeable if you wear a flesh colored cami underneath. because the fabric is light and the shape boxy, it is meant to be flowing, so i purchased my regular size. if you have small breasts you would probably prefer a smaller size. i only wish the blouse had been a litt",4,02/10/2018
Runs big,"Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4, 124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing, i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small, but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely, but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig",3,27/09/2018
Flattering and feminine,"I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse, but once i tried this on i fell in love. it drapes beautifullly, is not too short, and just feels pretty. for reference i am 5 feet 6 inches, 140 lbs. 36b and usually wear a medium in tops. the medium fits and flows perfectly, hiding all my mature woman problem areas.
i purchased quite a few items on the 40% off sale, and this is one of my top favorites. i love the versatility, just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy.",5,14/09/2018

"Looks like pajamas, tight in the underarms","I really liked the look of this top online, but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first, when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m, and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough, and as a teacher, i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly, my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.

Not worth it,"This top is very pretty, but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy), but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2"", 125lbs, 34b. i preferred the regular length, but if you like your tops to end at your waistband, then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top, so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale.",3,16/07/2018
Pretty print but didn't work.,"Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4, 135lbs, size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type, i'm hourglass and athletic.",2,09/02/2018
Love!,"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!",5,30/04/2018

Regular size too voluminous...,"When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very",3,09/06/2018
Slim fitted silouett,"I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants. good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored. i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust. the arm holes are fitted nicely as well, no bra exposure. looks very nice on. on point for sure?.

Average overall,"First off, this shirt is a hd in paris brand, not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.",3,29/03/2018
Quality is just not there...,"I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.",2,06/05/2018
Cute,"Cute and pretty, runs a little wide and short, just slightly. i feel like i have that issue with all retailer clothes though. love the back.",4,03/03/2018
Love,"This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...",5,10/09/2018
Fits so well!,"I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size, but this top fits perfectly. it is cut really well and very flattering.",5,15/03/2018
Pretty tank,Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.,5,14/05/2018
"Very cute, snug fit","Very cute flowy fit. i am generally a size small, 32-d chest. because the material has no give it fits perfectly (just barely) if it was any smaller or i was any larger it would be too small. very cute design.",4,16/02/2018
Great top!!,"I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!",5,22/02/2018
Cool versatile tank,I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.,5,06/08/2018
So summery!,Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.,5,02/05/2018
Buy this!,Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.,5,04/09/2018
Classy top,"I ordered this top in white and i was really excited for it to come in! once it once delivered and i tried it on it took me a second to decide if i liked it or not. i think i ordered it a size too big (i ordered a large, i'm usually a medium). it was somewhat boxy, but i think paired with the right pants and shoes it would be just what i wanted!",4,21/04/2018
"Nice summer top, but very billowy","I got the green motif color which is really multi color: blue, orange, purple, yellow, green and brown. the fabric is gauzy and sheer, nice and breezy for summer. there is a subtle stitching detail at the shoulders. i ordered my usual size, medium, and it fits well in the shoulders and arm holes, but it is extremely billowy in the body. i had to take it in a couple inches on each side to make it a little less full. it's still has some swing, but not quite as much as before.",4,30/10/2018
Blue stripe is pale! :(,"I bought this in the blue stripe and the color is not what is shown at all! the photo shows a bright, vibrant blue and white stripe top. i got a white and very light pastel blue stripe top. so disappointed because the top doesn't have that wow look as shown in the photo. however, it goes well with blue jeans even in the lighter shade of blue.

and, the fabric is nice and cool for hot summer days. the fit is tts. i bought a 16 and if you wear an 18 this will fit also. i didn't find this too box",4,21/02/2018
Here comes summer,"Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip",5,19/04/2018
Shrunk terribly!,"I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.",2,20/10/2018
Love this blouse!,"This is one of the best purchases f
i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",5,26/09/2018
Love it,I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!,5,04/08/2018
"Love, love, love it!",This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.,5,04/08/2018
Great staple piece!,"Great fit and quality. i'm 5'3"" and 130 lbs, size 4 fit perfectly. bought both the blue and black. could definitely dress up or down!",4,29/01/2018
Light and flowing,"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",5,08/10/2018
Not a white background,"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",5,24/08/2018
So many compliments,"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",5,02/09/2018
Great top,I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,5,10/06/2018
Super cute!,"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",5,06/02/2018
Soft and fun,"This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too ""blousey"" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!",5,25/02/2018
Odd cut,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,2,12/08/2018
Love this shirt!,"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",5,27/11/2018
The perfect button-down!,My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!,5,24/08/2018
"So soft, so versatile","Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.",5,31/03/2018
Beautiful softness,"This shirt has an incredible softness to it and the purple print is so lovely, i did end up returning it simply because the flowiness was a bit too much for me. i had tried the 2 and 4 and went with the 4 due to arm restrictions in the smaller size. too bad because it really is a lovely top. definitely worth a try in store!",4,15/06/2018
Light draping style,"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",5,15/02/2018
Love it!,This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!,5,04/09/2018
Great blouse,"I got the dark blue print which is a really pretty pattern. the fabric has a nice crinkly feel and the cut is very forgiving. i thought from the pictures it would be more of a traditional button down with straight lines. it actually is a looser fit but without the trapeze shape of some ""swing"" tops which i have found to be less flattering for those of us who are curvier on the bottom half. it's comfortable and flattering, could be tucked in or worn out and likewise dressed up or worn casually wi",4,29/07/2018
Really comfy and can be worn almost year round,"This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color, too, so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand, order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels ""slinky"" for lack of a better word. essentially, it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered, so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami, although in the lighter version i c",5,17/04/2018
Returned,I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,1,02/02/2018
Super-delicate fabric,"I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.",2,01/04/2018
Beautiful blouse,"I bought the black motif, the design lends to a nice pop of color.  the venting detail on the back is beautiful, but probably not as obvious on the black.  maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers.  i'm usually between a s/m or 6/8 in blouses.  i followed advice from other reviewers and got the 8- for room in the arms.  the blouse is very billowy- much more than in the photos, but i'm wearing it with skinny jeans and i love it!",4,01/10/2018
Cute casual shirt,"I got this shirt as a gift. it's cute and very comfortable. it is,however, a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath.",5,18/07/2018
Shrunk after first wash,This item states you should wash in cold water and tumble dry low heat. it shrunk after first wash in cold water and i didn&#39;t even use the dryer. do not wash. real bummer..,3,06/02/2018
Good shirt,"I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.",5,26/10/2018
My new favorite shirt,"I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.",5,16/03/2018
Shrunk,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.,1,03/02/2018
Versatile,"I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect, but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.",5,23/03/2018
Unique soft and comfy fall top,I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,5,01/08/2018
Bainbridge!,"I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom, the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!",5,10/04/2018
Perfect for work,"Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans",5,03/12/2018
So much fabric...,"Finally a pretty maeve shirt that actually fit my (apparently) giant hulk arms.. but it's so flowy/swingy i had to return it. this might just be a problem with being a larger lady, but the excess fabric made me feel like i was wearing a tent and made me look 10x bigger than i was around my waist/hips, even when balanced out with leggings. i thought about trying to size down but wasn't sure if that would even solve the excess fabric problem and still leave room in the arms. of course i can't try",3,26/05/2018
Cute and comfortable,I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.,5,25/02/2018
Lovely and fun to wear,"I really like how this shirt flows and feels. the details are super cute (double buttons in front, pleats in back). great shirt to transition to fall.",5,11/06/2018
Really versatile!,"I just love this top, it has a flattering cut, fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!",5,22/03/2018
Second time's the cahrm,"I tried this one twice, in the same day, the first time, i didn't like it, the stylist in the dressing room at the time dind't etiher, but then my favorite stylist finally showed up (:-) ) and i tried it on again, but at the time, had changed pants... made all the difference. you really need hte right pants for htis, but it is gorgeous.

i bought hte black color online, i liked it better, the white has stell colored polka dots, so if you want more of a spring color, also good for you.

style: ca",5,26/04/2018
Beyond cute,"This top is one of my favorites, i can't get over how much i love the design. the dots are adorable and i received a ton of compliments. the back of the top quite a bit longer, and it looks great. my only complaint is that it runs a bit small on the top. even though the shirt is perfectly sized on me, i bent over to slip on my shoe and one of the buttons popped off after less than a minute of wearing it.",4,17/11/2018
Not sure what i wore before i owned this shirt!,"I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou",5,23/11/2018
Pretty design but not the best quality,"I tried this on at the store, and though it was pretty, i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea, but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.",3,22/01/2018
Beautiful top!,"Stunning on, but mine was missing a button when i received it. i found a similar button and replaced it. still worth it, even though it arrived ""damaged""",4,17/07/2018
So cute,"This top is true to size for me, i'm 5'8'' 128lbs, and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big, i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms, the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect, i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel",5,18/03/2018
Fun and flirty,"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",5,06/05/2018
Sweet and fun without being too young,"5'7"", 135lbs, 34c, 27-28 waist. typically wear between a 2 or 4 in maeve. bought an 8 in this. blouse is incredibly sweet - the white is beautiful but i opted for the black bc it seemed more internship appropriate. the front and back are completely different lengths - not a traditional high-low. the fabric has little to no give and the back has buttons running down. size up 1 or 2 sizes to avoid popping buttons! gorgeous with jeans or pair with some fun cigarette trousers (cartonnier, for exampl",4,05/10/2018
Beautiful,"Love this top, it's a 100% cotton and looks amazing with jeans. you should consider ordering a size up, i am usually an 0, 32d and 107pound. tried the 0 in store it just didn't feel right the size 2 fit just right.
love the shirt, and got tons of complement:)",5,30/08/2018
"Love this shirt, but buttons are unstable","This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",1,30/09/2018
Tight in arms and bust,"So i really like this top. not my usual choice, but i'm trying to branch out. really like the top (i got the white one because they had it in my size). only thing is i could have sized down but arms/shoulders/bust are super tight so i went with the larger size. i got mine on sale and a button had already fallen off the back so forewarning that may be a problem in future.... 

but overall i really like this top.",4,12/08/2018
"Cute design, with adorable dots","This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person, i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now, spring, and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10, so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!",5,19/05/2018
Worst peplum top in history,"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",1,12/03/2018
Flattering,"This top is extremely well done. it looks classy and timeless. i tried on the white version in store, but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer.",5,30/04/2018
Button problems,"Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.",3,03/05/2018
"Pretty, soft, comfortable and true to size","I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length, hem, neckline, etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.

the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well",5,16/04/2018
Casual elegance!,I am so glad i purchased this top and read the reviews thoroughly. i am usually a 10 or medium in tops because of my broad shoulders (for reference 5'9 145 lbs and athletic build). i decided to size down to an 8. the top fits perfect and looks just as pictured. it is a bit more substantial then i expected. the details and embroidery are beautiful and make this top so uniquely retailer! it is casual in an elegant way. i will be pairing this with skinny jeans and/or white skinny pants. i cannot tell,4,03/10/2018
Heavy fabric. large top,"I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.

as an earlier reviewer noted, the top is not see-through, a plus.

the drawbacks, though, mean that i will be returning this top. 

1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose, even in that size, and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives",3,11/10/2018
On the fence --- some problems,"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",2,07/02/2018
Much lovelier in person,"A sales associate suggested this top and i'm glad she did. it's easy to miss at first!
-------------------
pros:
- beautiful detailing at the bottom that isn't as evident from pics here. it really sets the top apart.
- double-layered but breathable fabric means no see-through issues and can be worn in the hot summer months ahead.
- lace detailing at the top is nice and elegant.
- roomy without being too boxy. nice flow.
- great fabric. forgiving fit.
- can be dressed up or down.

Fantastic blouse!,I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.,5,22/10/2018
"Smaller arms, larger body","I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",2,29/08/2018
Another beautiful white top,Great fit,5,29/01/2018
Sold on reviews,"After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.",5,02/05/2018
The price is right!,"Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7"" 128lbs and took my usual size s.",5,12/09/2018
The perfect blouse,"This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special, yet everyday! i ordered the black, and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.",5,19/10/2018
Such a lovely top!,"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!",5,17/08/2018
Size 16 is perfect,I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!,5,12/07/2018
Sweet top,"This top is cute - nice fabric and design. pretty flattering for such a loose cut. my one concern though, was that when i was moving the peplum part kept riding up. i felt like i would constantly have to readjust the shirt to make sure it was lying flat. 

the shirt runs large. i'm usually a 6, and the 2 was plenty roomy.",4,24/10/2018
Lovely shirt,"I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room, and tried it on on impulse. i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric, and even more impressed with the price. i usually like my tops very fitted, and found this one hung loose, but not boxy. i have been wearing it quite a bit, sometimes with a camisole underneath, and sometimes not. i bought the one with the flowers, and it is not see-through, and the light fabric is good for our warm heat. i bought my usual s",5,04/08/2018
Great top!,I bought this b/c it looked exactly my style and i was right! i've worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great. i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer. i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachy-plaid color...,5,26/07/2018
Very flattering,I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.,5,08/07/2018
Flattering and so cute,I was afraid it would be too poufy but it isn't at all. i'd say it runs a bit large. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and the 6 fits perfectly.,4,15/09/2018
Cute and versatile in black,"I got this in black. it can be casual or dressy. very lightweight, comfortable and flattering. i ""collect"" black tops (since i rarely wear any other color) and this is now one of my favorites. i think it looks totally different in the black than it does in the other colors -- more refined, less casual. this runs quite large. i am a 0-2 but needed the 00 in this top.",5,06/02/2018
Run and buy.....,"Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious, it blends into the shirt",5,23/11/2018
A staple top,I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.,5,09/09/2018
Love this top,"I bought this in the store without trying it in the black. when i put it on, i loved it. so much so that i went back and purchased the black patterned one. equally as nice.",5,23/09/2018
Cool for the summer,"Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear, not fussy, no special bra needed.",5,03/11/2018
Great wardrobe addition,"I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy.  i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.",5,27/10/2018
Casual yet office appropriate,"This can take you from office to casual afternoon. i got the plaid print in store. it is much nicer in person than in the picture. very cute neckline and detailing. i'd say true to size, slightly large. i wore my regular size and it fits fine without looking too large.",4,24/01/2018
Great staple top,I bought this on sale in black. it doesn't look like much online but it is very flattering and super thin and airy which is great for warm weather. tts- i'm an 8/10 38c and the 10 fits just right.,5,17/06/2018
Simply beautiful,"I bought both versions of these tops. the print one has brown, pale pink, and cream colors. these tops look exactly like the picture. they are tts and come with a cami attached. i normally wear a medium and the size 8 is perfect and the arm holes are properly sized, not huge.",4,09/02/2018
Pretty but not for me,"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy, so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i returned it for a size 2, which fit much better. in the end, i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape, and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made, but it just wasn't for me.",3,27/11/2018
Cute top,I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.,5,08/06/2018
Pretty and feminine,"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",5,07/05/2018
Beautiful cream linen/cotton crochet back top,"This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does, it feels soft on the skin, light-weight, and has a nice bounce to it. it's",5,19/02/2018
"Beautiful, flowy,",I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!,5,12/04/2018
Perfect in every way,Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see,5,26/06/2018
Recommend if you hav hte right coloring for it,"Love this top, the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim, love hte colors, but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!",5,30/08/2018
Love the details,"This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.",5,21/04/2018
Functionality with flair,This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,5,28/07/2018
I love it!,"I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i",5,21/03/2018
Pretty blouse,"Most peasant tops have a lot of detail at the chest, such as gathering, yoke inlay, ties etc. i like this peasant blouse because it has a simple top part, so it does not add volume to the chest. good for busty figures. pretty top, though colors a bit more autumnal than pictured.",4,22/07/2018
Horrible,"This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.",1,18/07/2018
Could be cute on the right person,I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.,2,24/04/2018
Inconsistent all the way around,I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c,3,13/06/2018
Beautiful blouse,"I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!",5,07/10/2018
Not at all as it looks online,Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.,2,12/06/2018
Too bad,"I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors, really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t",2,08/02/2018
So disappointed!,"This top is much stiffer, more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too, and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun, drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.",3,22/10/2018
Another floreat top misses the mark,"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 
1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.
2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.
3. in the picture, t",1,18/03/2018
So unflattering....nothing like picture,"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......
it runs really big
it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.
colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.
fabric feels cheap and stiff
lining is stuff and poorly sewn.
i haven't one positive thing to say about t",1,29/07/2018
Fall boho,"As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy, loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.",5,18/10/2018
Beautiful peasant top,"I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back. (there is no retailer near me...) i kept the xs, and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right, but by the end of the day it stretched just enough, and felt just right. really pretty top. i received a lot of compliments on it.",5,29/07/2018
Much prettier in person,"I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it, but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down, as it is on the model, or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.",5,24/06/2018
Beautiful blouse,"In truth, it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however, i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.",4,17/02/2018
Looks better online runs small,"This top does look better online and one reviewer said. it also looks good in-person but runs small. i usually wear xl, in some cases l. i tried l, it was small so i sent it back for xl. the xl fit perfectly at the top but was tight at the bottom. the bottom pulled at the seams, so i am sending it back. the embroidery itself is very pretty, it is a nice dressy top that can be worn with multiple colored pants or leggings. it just didn't fit me at the bottom. i think it would work better for a lea",4,10/10/2018
Gorgeous,"I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!",5,23/05/2018
Comfortable and beautiful to boot,"I don't understand the low rating. the head opening in my size (2) is perfect and i don't have a small head. 
the style is both flattering on many shapes and very comfortable. the embroidery is gorgeous and the blue hue can be paired with many colors. it be worn with jeans on the weekend and also dresses up beautifully for the office if worn with a jacket and a pair of slacks. i wore it with an olive jacket and jeans last week and received compliments! 
the caveat is that it wrinkles.. a lot.",4,31/01/2018
Lovely embellishments,"This tunic has nice, soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out. it's comfortable and the fabric is very nice, but it is not flannel as advertised. the tunic is made out of a double-gauze cotton, which is a great fabric with a casual look.",5,14/06/2018
"Easy, cool, awesome!","This is such a great piece. throw this top on with a pair of skinnies and some booties and you're dressed. it walks the line between too tight and too loose beautifully for my figure. love the contrast lining. it washes beautifully (i hang to dry). i wore it twice the first week i owned it. size s was best for me. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and generally a size 6.",5,02/08/2018
Mid winter addition,"I picked this tunic up on sale; it works wonderfully with several of my cardigans and vests; just add skinny jeans or leggings and some boots for a fun, super comfortable look. the sleeves are oddly extra long, but not a deal breaker as rolling them up gives that unfinished cool look. i hate ironing, but i will iron this top as its so much fun to wear. the embroidered and beaded detail is quite nice.",4,10/10/2018
Maybe not for petites?,"I ordered xs petite and was pretty excited when this arrived based on the reviews. however (and maybe it's just me) the top was really, really large on me, especially around the shoulders and upper arms, so the shape was not flattering. sorry to have to return this item.",4,01/10/2018
Too big,"Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6"", 130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame",3,28/01/2018
Fun fall tunic,I am curvy on bottom. i am 5ft 9 and this is very long. it's ok to wear with jeans or leggings and the longer tunics are stylish these days. however it's long enough to be a dress. i bought a large my usual size. i gave it 4 stars because it is sized bigger then a large.it is 100% cotton so maybe it will shrink a little. i am ok with it though. it is very loose and a relaxed fit. the embroidery on the neckline has pretty little beadwork all over the stitching. very cute detail. i love the patter,4,30/04/2018
"Huge, size down!","This is a really unique floreat top. unfortunately the petite sizes sold out so i went with an xs. this was too big?too wide in the shoulders and chest, all around actually. my other issue is that it's a heavy material. i just feel like if i was wearing it around all day, i might burn up in it. it did not feel like it was breathable. and finally, i'm 5'2""?even the xs was too long in the back. 

i could see how this could look really cool on the right person?i'm just not that person to pull it",4,16/08/2018
Really cute,"This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos, but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked, but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns, embroidery and beading. also, it is long and does run large, but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite, and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.",5,02/12/2018
Stunning,This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.,5,18/06/2018
"Beautiful, but need to right sizing","This top is very feminie, i love hte pelats and flower details. it can be, however, a bit boxy, i think if you have wider hips, i might avoid. great to go with skinny pants/ejans, though. could size down, if shoulders are not too wide...",4,18/07/2018
Perfect party top,This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.,5,28/04/2018
Delicate and beautiful,"I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous! it fit true to size, and goes with my whole romantic, feminine style that i have without being overly girly. not too sheer, so no need for a tank underneath, and being that it is neutral, it will go with just about everything i own! love it!",5,03/10/2018
Very flattering but between seasons,This is beautiful on. it flatters the figure nicely. the material is a rougher cotton which seems oppressive for summer even though thin. it is very low cut but it looks wonderful.,4,09/03/2018
"Nice, but odd fit (for me)","I'm thinking that this might be a hit for the petites out there, but it didn't quite work on my long torso. the seam across the bust fell a little too high making the shirt ride up and the sleeve ended at a weird spot (not quite 3/4 sleeves, and also not long sleeves...but there is a band that makes it feel weird). the v-neck in the front is low, but offered full coverage on my 34a bust, but i can see it being pretty revealing on someone better endowed. fabric and color is nice, and it's a prett",4,15/10/2018
Big busts not allowed!,"This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back.",1,03/07/2018
Beautiful but thin,"I am very petite (size 00, xxs) and i got the smallest size this top came in and it fit great in the bust and arms but the bottom billowed out a little too much for my body frame type. it is so beautiful i had considered getting it altered, but the material was simply too see through so it had to go back. beautiful gauze material and detailing though!",4,30/07/2018
"Almost ,but not quite...","I really wanted to love this top when i got it, but not so much. it fit nicely through the bust and torso, but flared out way too much, it ended up looking like a maternity top. maybe because i am more of an hourglass shape. another thing, it was very low cut, i would not have been able to wear this without a cami underneath. the fabric didn't seem to be the best quality, it also had a funny smell too it when i took it out of the package. this shirt was not worth the price. sadly, this was a mis",3,09/02/2018
Nice top,"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!",5,23/07/2018
Worth every penny!,The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type.  i normally wear 12/14 and 12 fit great (if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size) spillage is possible with wrong size lol.,5,24/09/2018
Cute but runs small and short,"I love this top, the beading and detail is wonderful, i actually liked it even more when i saw it in person. but when i tried it on it is really small in the neck and arm openings and seems short, definitely a different fit than how it appears on the model. i'm trading in for a size up and hoping that does the trick!",4,07/06/2018
Even more beautiful than pictured,"This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to",5,30/05/2018
Gorgeous and flattering!,I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,5,28/09/2018
Absolutely gorgeous!,"When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person, it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4, but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected, considering i have a 32dd bust, but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes, even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders, so maybe that",5,26/06/2018
Too short waisted!,"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",1,16/08/2018
Wonderful shirt!,I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.,5,23/02/2018
"Beautiful top, but....","I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still",3,25/01/2018
Beautiful but fit is off,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,2,08/04/2018
Beautiful top!,Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!,5,21/08/2018
Pretty - but tight arms!,"This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger, a nice blue, and a good transition piece. but, the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin, but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it, but sadly, i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms, i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work, but for me at least, i think it",3,09/08/2018
Beautiful!,"Love this top. fits true to size. not to boxy,, sleeves are so cute! looks very rich. a must have in your wardrobe!",5,26/11/2018
So sorry i had to return,"I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5', 106#, 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized, or defective. all i can say, if you have skinny arms, you'll love it.",1,25/11/2018
Flowing comfort,I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.,5,12/06/2018
Love the sleeves!,"I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves, which are all the rage right now, add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!",5,03/02/2018
Flattering and stylish,"I got this top in white/rust and it is darling. the lining keeps it from being too see through. the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length. i get many compliments each time i wear it. i am 5'1"", 103 lbs and take xs- fit was true to size.",5,11/05/2018
Bohemian bliss,Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!,5,19/05/2018
Beautiful top!,"This top is so perfect for the fall... flowy, beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown boots,gorgeous! wore it once and got a lot of compliments!  i'm 5'2"" 125 and ordered a size 4. 2 worked too but just a tad tight in the arms. :)",5,16/10/2018
Beautiful,This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquã©s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl,5,05/09/2018
Gorgeous details!,"This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.",5,13/10/2018

Unique top,"This top is beautifully detailed , it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!",5,30/10/2018
Absolutely gorgeous top,"This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace, black flower appliquã©s, silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs, 34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist",5,06/02/2018
Retailer from the days of yore and yesteryear,"Like other reviewers, when i saw this top in person i was struck by it. i would never have even looked twice at it online. i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one. the only thing i'd disagree with is that it runs true to size. at my store, there was only 1 left (in a size 10). i'm usually a 4/6 but i figured i'd try it on since the style is loose anyway. and the 10 fit very nicely. i did try a 6 in another store and found the slits came too high and th",5,11/11/2018
Gorgeous detail,"The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1, 92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted, the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly.",5,13/11/2018
Wearing this to my reunion!,"I had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion. as soon as i saw this, i knew it was perfect for the occasion. i'm sure i'll get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down.",5,13/05/2018
Gorgeous top despite some flaws,"I saw this top online, but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'",5,26/08/2018
Beautiful design,"My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled, & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!",5,16/08/2018
Beautiful top,Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.,5,23/08/2018
A true beauty,"Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.",5,09/09/2018
In love!,"The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous, from the lace, to the sequins, to the rhinestones! that said, the details are not overpowering, yet more subtle. can't wait to wear this over the holiday season. sure to get tons of compliments!!",5,23/04/2018
Gorgeous detail,This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,5,14/04/2018
Exquisite top!,"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",5,16/08/2018
Retailer amazing,"I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear.",5,08/07/2018
Veille peasant top,"I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?",1,08/06/2018
Beautiful!,I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!,5,12/03/2018
Versatile and gorgeous,"I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!",5,08/08/2018
Perfect,"I love this blouse. i debated because of the cost. but this is a top i will wear forever. i have not found any of the issues other reviewers have. fit fine in the arms and the length was perfect and i have a long torso. i wear it with a nude bra and i don't have any problems with its being see through. i wore it to a party the other day and received several compliments. i was also stopped in the store and asked where i got it. it looks expensive and special. i worn it with jean, black jeans and",5,31/05/2018
Old retailer,"Ok, so yes, it is true that the top part where the sleeves are can be snug a little, especially if you work out, but overall i found the top to run true to my regular size (i only tried on the 0, didn't try bigger). the length was great for me being short, i didn't think i need the petite (i usually do for pants and skirts/dresses, tops on and off). the look of the shirt is also classic, flowy and it looked great with e half tuck. the embroidery is also nice though one part of it seemed loose. a",4,15/09/2018
Wanted to love it but way too short!!!,"I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price, it really should be cut better.",2,22/09/2018
"It is not white color, it looks beige indoors","The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,
the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.
the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.",1,06/02/2018
Need to see it in person,What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!,5,03/03/2018
"Wanted to love it, but...",I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,2,28/09/2018
Great shirt,"Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.",5,11/08/2018
Unique and adorable,"The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops, but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly, but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price, it is worth tailoring.",4,17/04/2018
"Great, versatile piece",A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect.,5,27/05/2018
Short and boxy,"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",2,23/01/2018
Just lovely,"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli",5,09/10/2018
Stunning lace top,This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!,5,09/11/2018
Not a fan,The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.,2,13/08/2018
So different in a good way!,"This blouse is pretty sheer, but perfect for a summer day. good coverage in the front and under arms on the sides for limited bra exposure, and a very cute opening in on the lower back.",4,09/07/2018
Cute top,"I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion. i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it. the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath, but i think it's adorable. don't be scared away by the review below!",5,16/06/2018
Unwearable,"I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n",2,18/09/2018
Peach delight,I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,5,05/09/2018
Old world meets modern day,This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.,5,01/06/2018
Light and airy,Perfect summer/fall top. can also layer it. i wear it over a tank tunic and love it.,4,31/03/2018
Gorgeous peasant top,"The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v",5,28/01/2018
Not great,Liked the netting around the collar but the whole blouse was very baggy. order size down.,3,16/11/2018
Flattering and colorful,Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.,5,21/11/2018
Everyday perfect!,I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!,5,07/05/2018
Subtle bohemian,"Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.",5,07/12/2018
Beautiful print and colors,"This is a really pretty shirt - the colors are beautiful.  it runs large, and it's semi-sheer.  shape is loose and boxy, but because it's more sheer, it didn't seem as boxy.  i'm tall, and this was long enough.  only change would be to make the sleeves a little less bell like.  not tight, but lose some of the volume.",4,13/09/2018
"Beautiful, unique top","I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i can't wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles.",5,09/05/2018
Annoying as heck but too pretty to return,"I fell in love with this top when i saw it online. i love tracy reese! the pattern is beautiful and the yellow is even brighter in person. i ordered a size small even though i normally wear an xs in all tops. for whatever reason, there was no xs offered, which is odd. the straps are adjustable which is good but unfortunately you absolutely cannot wear this top without fashion tape to keep the straps from falling off your shoulders. the straps slipped off my shoulders constantly. i wore a coobie",4,14/10/2018
Love this!,"Such a pretty blouse, drapes nicely though it is a little on the large side. i got my usual medium and had to fix the straps a few times, but a fun summer top that makes you feel super feminine. maybe i could have sized down but i got it online on clearance so i didn't have the chance to try on another size. still love it!",4,22/10/2018
My favorite summer top!,"I just love the bright yellow floral pattern and the off the shoulder sleeves. the loose fit is really ideal for when i just want to throw something on and run out the door but look super cute at the same time. it runs a little large to give you the flowy look, but i like things flowy so this wasn't an issue for me but a plus!",5,23/05/2018
"Orange lace part runs big, but lining is small","I snapped this up under the 20% off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty. i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops. it is huge! i could have taken a medium if not for the lining -- which is tiny! the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips. and it looks like a block and makes me look wide. who needs that? like i said, a medium would fit better and would not be so wide, but i fe",2,10/03/2018
Very pretty,"Love the shirt. exteemely comfortable, simple and nice.",5,30/07/2018
More blue than grey and way too big,"Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens",2,05/03/2018
Grey not color as pictured on website,"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",2,04/09/2018
It is a crop top,"This top is very nice, very pretty. i thought the design on the top is more shiny but it is embroidery-like threads. it looks quite nice but is very very short, like a crop top. it came just down to the top of my tummy. i wish it were longer, i would have kept it. but it is a nice top, flattering for curvy figures.",4,26/08/2018
"Beautiful option with ""stand out"" detail!","This is my first tracy reese piece, and i love it already. the somewhat edgy, unique, grommet and navy embroidery on the neckline and upper arms is very flattering on the body. the silky cotton texture surprised me; it's 60% cotton/40% viscose. it drapes well and feels good on. i will definitely enjoy wearing this for work or nice casual. i love that it is regular bra friendly. and that i don't need to stress about a low neckline. i am size 8/medium, 34f, and the medium is terrific. i got the an",5,28/04/2018
Surprised how much i likee this!,"I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,",5,16/07/2018
Breath of fresh air,"This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not",5,05/09/2018
"Fantastic quality, shows bra straps in back","I have always love tracy reese products. this blouse is really fun, nice fabric and the proportions are perfect. but why does it have to show the wide band of my bra across my back? the cut out dips low so i can't imagine a bra that would work with it. it's a 70's hippy themed blouse- maybe the designer expects us to go braless? unfortunately i'm going to have to wear a cami underneath it. my girls need support!",4,14/11/2018
Huge arm holes,"Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm? 

this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.",2,13/10/2018
Awesome!,"What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!",5,29/03/2018
Surprisingly beautiful,"The picture online does not do this picture justice. it is actually very pretty and delicate. i love the sequins. other reviewers were correct it is a little big, but a great tunic to dress up or down. i love it.",4,19/11/2018
Beautiful top,"The top itself is beautiful and colors are like pictured. my only issue was the size. i went for medium ( i'm usually m or l) and i'm 5'4"" so i can get away with regular and pettite. this top was way too long. looked like dress on me. i'm sending it back for exchange",4,01/07/2018
Sparkly fun,"This shirt runs big, it's very long. material is very pretty and it is lined. i am keeping it for that spontaneous need to wear something sparkly...dinner party maybe?",4,14/07/2018
Love this top,"This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7"" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot.",4,14/09/2018
Huge!!!,I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).,3,29/06/2018
Nice but complicated,The top was very nice and i liked the material. my problem was getting it on with the cami being attached to the top. it took me a while to figure it out. and for that reason alone i returned it.,3,17/05/2018
Huge,"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large.",3,13/09/2018
Love the design,Really like the loose flowiness. runs big went from med to small with better results. style is forgiving,4,12/06/2018
Pretty top,Nice color and great work but runs little large.,3,06/03/2018
Gorgeous colors,"This is a really beautiful top. the colors are lovely a subtle. it is larger than i expected. i ordered a small which is my usual size and it is more of a baggy tunic. it still works because the material is so sheer, but does not fit me like the photo size down",4,07/11/2018
"Awesome, such a pretty top!","This shirt looked plain online, but when i see it in store, i thought it's so pretty! it is the over-sized style, when i tried it on, it's so flattering, even though it is over-sized but it doesn't make you look chunky at all! i got it while it was on sale with extra 25% off! i range from 2 to 6, xs, s for retailer sizes. i got a xs for this top.",5,27/05/2018
Beautiful tunic,"This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole, too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.",4,14/04/2018
Removing the liner,"I love the pattern and flowy design.  i also like the peach liner but i will use that on other outfits i own and replace it with a slip that has a designed hem.  this top is too long for me to wear as a top. so i will wear as a dress with the a longer slip.  i'm hoping that the sequins will remain intact for the most part as the construction of everything is too delicate.  bought the size s and i am 6'3"" 140# 39-28-35.",5,04/02/2018
Light & airy,Beautiful pale colors. there is too much room under the arms and at the sides but it will be an easy alteration. plan on wearing with skinny jeans.,4,19/08/2018
Didnt love it,"While there is nothing wrong with this top, it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store, maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much, especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.",3,06/12/2018
Flowy blouse with a little sparkle,"I ordered this blouse after it went on sale - i'm not typically the blouse-y type, but i thought i'd try it. for me, and i'm a pretty consistent small across brands, it was quite flowing and a little long, but that may be what someone wants. it was a little light in color to look good on me, but i think this would be really cute with dark skinny jeans - easy to dress up or down :)",4,14/09/2018
Sleeves not like those on the model,The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,1,07/09/2018
Nope,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,1,28/11/2018
Ready for clown college!,"This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. 

buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.",1,18/10/2018
Love it !!!!,"I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season. i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate, and you can still tuck it in. the length is perfect. the colors are awesome. t paired it with a pair of pilco cords. it easily work with a skirt or dress pants.
i would highly recommend!!!",5,12/07/2018
Lisette tank,"Beautiful,well made top.it just runs small not for me",3,29/08/2018
Really poor quality,"This shirt is purportedly made of silk, but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.",1,07/02/2018
Beautiful but runs small,I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad,3,13/06/2018
"Pretty in picture; but, disappointing in reality","I really wanted to love this tank top.  it has vibrant colors and a unique pattern; however, i should have listened to the reviews.  there was way too much fabric!  it made me look pregnant!  the tank top is going to be returned.",3,18/07/2018
"Shorter than described, well-made","I ordered a size xl in the pink version with the multi-colored fabric. the fit is true to size other than the length. it isn't 27 inches. it's the petite length even though i ordered the regular sizing. i ordered a 2nd one and again, the length was around 25 in. instead of 27. so, it will be more of a swingy, shorter top than shown. but, through the arms/body, it's true-to-size. i'll be dry-cleaning this so it won't shrink since i need the length.

the colors and embroidery are exactly as pict",4,04/10/2018
"Beautiful top, but a steep price tag","I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it. 

but...the price tag. $98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me. i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it's still available once it goes on sa",5,30/06/2018
Summer lovin,This is the perfect summer top. super lightweight but with a little swing in it so it is not tight across the hips. the bright colors go with almost anything and the detailing at the top makes this dressier than a regular shirt. great with skirts and jeans!,5,16/09/2018
Cute top,"I got this top in the pink. the colors and pattern are beautiful - i received so many compliments. it is very comfortable - it is ""swingy"" so i paired it with skinny jeans. 
i usually wear an xs or s - 0 or 2 in retailer tops - i got this in an xs and it fit perfectly.",5,05/06/2018
Great colors,The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful. the material is soft but not diaphanous. it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing. love it!,5,25/11/2018
Cute classic with a modern twist,"I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable, and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said, the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering, forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section, then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern, subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater",5,30/04/2018
Even prettier in person,"I ordered this top in the pink in a medium (i usually wear a small or medium in retailer shirts). it fit tts with not being too short. the embrodiery is very pretty, better in person than online. my only complaint is it's a bit blousey, so you would need to either tuck it in or wear with skinny jeans/shorts. for reference, i am 5"" 4.5""' 135 lbs and a 32c.",4,03/04/2018
Love this top!,"I agree with the other reviewer who said she cannot believe it's not flying off the shelf. this looks gorgeous on and the fit is perfect. i ordered my usual size m. i am 5'3"" 34dd and it looks amazing. it is breezy and flowing but without the baggy look. it is so cute with jeans or leggings. the fabric is the perfect weight- light but still thick enough that it's comfortable and my light bra is not seen underneath. love this top!!!",5,18/08/2018
Quirky,Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.,5,28/05/2018
Not so flattering.,"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",2,11/08/2018
Sleeves destroy this beautiful blouse,"This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.",1,25/02/2018
Not worth the price,"I ordered this blouse as a gift for my mom. it is too pricey to live up to my expectations. it is quite sheer and the hem of the sleeves are unfinished which you can't see in the pictures. this makes a very expensive blouse look cheap. it is made of viscose and dry clean only. the material used is not on par with the price in my opinion. if it had been real silk or another natural fiber, ok. but for me this and the unfinished hem along with the price is a deal breaker for me.",3,20/11/2018
Very see through,"I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.
it is cute though!",2,15/06/2018
Fabric is flimsy,"It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however, it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.",3,21/07/2018
Might as well wear my husband's shirt,"This shirt is enormous and, as the title of my review suggests, it looks like a men's button down. the fabric is quite sheer, but that's actually what i liked best about it. i just looked completely shapeless in this top & wish i had realized it before i wore it out because i would definitely have returned it. perhaps if i had bought it 2 sizes smaller i might have liked it better - it didn't fit anything like the model photos suggest - it's huge. not ""easy/slouchy"".",3,06/07/2018
Stunning perfection,"Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.",5,13/03/2018
Love,"Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.",5,25/05/2018
Love this top!,Didn't even wait for a sale on this top! so adorable and fits great. i bought a medium and wear a small in most things. i like that it is a touch big as it hangs better that way.,5,22/10/2018
Top has great colors,Love this top! very flattering and fits true to size! top hits below mid thigh.,4,03/06/2018
Great if you are thin!,"I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin, it might work for you too.",2,06/11/2018
"Too boxy, pretty material","I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.",2,29/08/2018
Better in person,"I am going to have to disagree with the first reviewer. this is not the most beautiful top i have ever purchased from retailer, but i like it. it is a nice change from the swing silhouette that tendd to look like maternity wear on me. the key to this is to tighten the drawstring a bit. it is a working drawstring all the way around, and i find that the top is much cuter with the drawstring cinched a bit. i actually like the flowing arms, too. the fabric is lightweight - nice for the very warm midwe",4,21/09/2018
Had high hopes but...,"Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.",1,02/07/2018
Lovely summer into fall top!,"Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.",5,08/05/2018
"Gorgeous, unique top","I purchased this top in the store, intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy, and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front, it looks pretty traditional, but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large, though, as i purchased an xs and still h",4,14/05/2018
Dressy or casual,"I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!",5,22/02/2018
So comfortable,This is such a cute top. it runs large...i bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium. it's flowy and comfy. looks great with dark jeans.,5,07/12/2018
Party in the back,I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go,5,07/03/2018
Best pick for the fall !,"Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .",5,11/07/2018
Nice but large,"I love this top. the design is very good, i love the pleats at the back, and i tried both colors. i prefer blue even though both look good. the fit is very loose mainly due to the pleats at the back. i usually wear xl but bought this in an l, which was also very loose. i think an m would be too tight across the shoulders but loose lower because of the pleats. i am keeping the blue because i like this style, with fitted pants it would work well.",4,16/05/2018
Lovely tank for fall,This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,5,17/11/2018
Totally cute and unique,Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket,5,10/03/2018
Petite frames will love this!,"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",1,14/07/2018
Beautiful but small,"I made the mistake of ordering a medium instead of large and have the same fit issues as other reviewers. it is tight in the back through the shoulders, so if you're considering it i would stick with your larger of your size range. the print is beautiful as is the fabric. it looked okay on me from the side but i am short waisted. it fell at the perfect length on me too. there's just something about the fit that didn't wow me so i don't plan to reorder, but i do think it would be lovely on thinne",4,27/04/2018
"My recommendation is a ""maybe""","This top is for someone flat chested and skinny. i really like the styling, color, fabric and everything except that it's not for my body type. i am a 36dd and have a little bit of a stomach... so it makes me look fat from the sides.
the pictures taken on the model are from the front and back - but i will bet she would still look good in it from the sides! will be returning it.",3,21/06/2018
Print looks just like the photo,This is a really pretty print on a decent top. the only reason i returned is because it didn't look good with my skin tone and the fabric is thin. i'd planned to use it as a later under cardigans.,4,13/09/2018
Feminine and romantic,"This blouse is very flattering. it drapes well and i love the textures. only problem is the head hole is a little small so if you buy the white one, put your makeup on after you have it on and remove your makeup before sliding it off. i bought an extra small even though i'm usually a small. lovely top. a lot of people have commented on it.",5,21/04/2018
Not worth full price!,"I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately, i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that, it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all, i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!",3,08/02/2018
Love it so much that i bought both colors!,"I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!",5,19/08/2018
Lovely but color not true to pic,"I ordered this in a small and i am 32b and the fit is perfect. lovely details and very well made but the online pics make it look like a soft periwinkle blue, however when i pulled it out of the shipping bag, it was more gray-blue. dare i say...country blue. even the pictures i took in this top make the color look different than it really is. i almost sent it back and i love the color blue but it was soooo not what i was expecting. it grew on me so i'm keeping it in spite of it.",4,11/06/2018
Delicate and elegant,"This blouse is stunning. it's ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms. my bust size is 32c. i ordered the xxs in both sizes (not petite, as i have a longer torso) and they fit perfectly! they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better - obviously - because it fits better. the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b",5,22/08/2018
The perfect white top,"Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!",5,10/10/2018
Feminine and pretty style,I love this blouse. i wasn't sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style. the quality is excellent. i bought a size small and i wear a size 2-4 or xs-s in retailer most of the time. i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted (34c). i'm 5'9 and i didn't like where the gathering hit with the xs. very flowy without looking like a maternity top. it's also lightly lined so i don't have to wear a cami. warning - this shirt is long. if you are on the short side you may,5,03/07/2018
Perfect for work,"I absolutely love this top. i managed to snag one that had been returned to a store, so i didn't have to order it. i love the cute and the overall boho feel to it. i feel like it's true to size, as i'm normally a medium in retailer.",5,13/09/2018
"Love, love, love!","Great arm coverage, soft material, flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.",5,28/06/2018
Best top ever,"I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1"", 115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!",5,10/08/2018
Instant love!,"Saw this online, but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on, but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it, which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small, but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same, with maybe a tad mo",5,03/05/2018
"Pretty, stylish, romantic top","I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday, this romantic top is beautifully detailed, very soft, comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight.",5,31/05/2018
Beautiful yet simple,"Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!",5,23/04/2018
So pretty but be careful,"I am 5'6"" and 140b, i'm usually a s and that is the size i bought. i loved the fit of the top and wore it immediately. then i washed it just as the instructions said and the liner shrunk about 3"" (just as another reviewer stated) and the sleeves were much tighter and a little shorter. however, i loved the top so much that i took the top back to the store and exchanged. the store was super understanding about it and i was able to order the same size. it's back ordered, but once i get the new top",4,14/05/2018
Beautiful top,"Loved the material and the feel. however, it does run a bit large on the shoulders so i had to return.",4,12/06/2018
Wanted to love,"This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews, i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however, this top hangs like a tent. also, the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar",3,23/04/2018
Cute top but very oversized,Ordered my usual medium. it swallowed me. have returned to store and they ordered me a small to try. very cute comfortable top,4,10/09/2018
Great fall find!,"Beautifully detailed top that pairs well with dark denim. top is a bit wide, but i think that is the style. a unique and different piece to add to your wardrobe!",4,26/07/2018
Best birthday shirt ever!,"Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday. i heard shouts of this being her new go-to top.
her roomies have already tried to borrow it. super comfy with a beautiful off-the-shoulder style.
no one can go wrong with this!",5,02/07/2018
Fun top for fall!,This is a great top going into the fall season. it runs a little large. i went down one size and it fits perfect!,5,29/10/2018
Long enough for tall women,"Being six feet tall, i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women, and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look, you can sometimes gain extra length, and it's true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues, and while it is billowy, it's not horribly so. i would think, however, if you're between sizes, or not worried about height, i'd go with the smaller option. adorable, comfy, casual while being dressy enough for a night out!",4,10/09/2018
Darling top,Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small,5,24/04/2018
Such a fun top!,"Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders, so this is a definite for my fall / winter season.",5,15/09/2018
"Too much fabric, shoulders won't stay down","This is a gorgeous print, but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds, but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.",2,03/11/2018
Didn't look great on me...,"It does run large as most reviewers noted. i opted for the pxs and it was still very large and the way that the elastic at the top hit me it bunched funny and made my chest look huge and i'm only a b cup. it added a good two cup sizes to my chest and it just looked odd. the length of the petite was good for me at only 5'4"" so the length did not overwhelm but the width was still really too wide. love the fabric and the lace at the hemline. it just wasn't for me but for those it works for it is be",3,07/03/2018
Unique,"I am usually between a s/m.  bought it in the small and glad i did.  the blouse is billowy.  had some trouble at first getting the top to stay ""off the shoulder"" because it raises up when you raise your arms (obviously).  stretched out just enough and is now comfortable.  the black lace design at the bottom is different and pretty.",4,23/04/2018
Great transitional top,This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!,5,01/04/2018
Love it!!,"I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom",5,18/04/2018
Best top ever!,"This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!",5,06/02/2018
Gorgeous top! love that it comes in petite,"I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s",5,13/06/2018
Love this top,From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.,5,26/05/2018
Prettier in black but would pass on ivory,"It's a pretty top with a lot of intricate detail and love the edge the studs give it but it looks fuddy duddy in ivory. looks nicer in black but you loose some of the detail in the dark color. the lace is not soft either but has more of a polyester, slightly scratchy feel. sizing is true to size and it fits well if the style floats your boat.",3,23/01/2018
Another beauty from maeve!,"I am a big fan of maeve tops. i love the beading and structure of this top. despite the fullness of the design, the fit is flattering",5,03/03/2018
Adore this top!,"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i",5,12/08/2018
Beautiful top!,"I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!",5,27/10/2018
"Unique, detailed - lovely!","This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle, not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top, there is a lot of fabric, but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!",4,17/07/2018
Terrible,"I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.",1,10/09/2018
Cute piece for fall,I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,5,17/08/2018
Love this shirt,"I love the colors. originally purchased a large for my broad shoulders and it was too big and too long for 5'4"". exchanged it for a petit medium and it fits great. will have to wait for cooler days to wear it since it is a heavy cotton and the weather is still very hot intexas.",5,27/10/2018
Runs large,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!,3,27/04/2018
Beautiful colors/quality material,Really pretty top. very different colors and style = nothing like anything i have. delivered in timely manner. highly recommend.,5,07/11/2018
Perfect find,I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.,5,13/03/2018
Petite all the way,"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them).",5,08/09/2018
Quality could be better,"I finally got my backorder today. i have a feeling that they might have rushed to make these and cut costs during production because as per all the reviews, i ordered my usual xs (122 lbs, 5'5"", 32d) and it just fits. all reviews previously before the backordered shirts were sent out, stated that the shirts ran big and people who normally wear a medium, bought an xs. i will keep my xs, but i would have purchased a small for a roomier fit. i have to wear a tank under it because it's short in the",4,27/01/2018
"Recommend, reservedly","I'm not sure how i feel about this shirt. i love the fabric, which is soft, lightweight, and richly colored. the polka dot trim is quirky and fun, and i like the idea of the twisted hem. the cut is generous in width, for sure; i ended up ordering a small because i swam in my usual medium-to-large sizes, but the length of the small barely works. the sleeves are juuuust long enough, and the shirt hits me just at the hip, not nearly as far down as the model shots show. it may be because i'm busty a",4,02/07/2018
Perfect shirt!!!,I love this shirt. it is great quality and hangs perfectly! please make more colors in this one. i would buy all of them!!,5,21/06/2018
Flannel meets funky,"Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel, yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine, sexy, comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small, wish i would've went for a petite x-small, however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3, 110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.",5,28/07/2018
Disappointing,"Ordered this top online and wanted to love it but the fit was very off. i love the drape in the front, but it did not hit in the right place. the fabric was soft, but not as high end looking as i was expecting. i love flannel tops and wanted a more formal look, but sadly this is going back.",3,04/04/2018
"Beautiful, but not flattering","When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well, and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable, but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just",3,03/09/2018
Draped plaid buttondown,"Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small.",5,11/08/2018
So soft and cozy,"I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.",5,14/10/2018
Beautiful!,This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,5,25/07/2018
Love the twist bottom,"Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt.
i highly recommend it!",5,21/06/2018
A great pick for summer,"I'm normally a small in retailer tops, but i could tell that this would run big. i'm glad i sized down to an extra small. this top is flowy and airy without being baggy. the colors are summery and beautiful. my only complaint is that it's a bit sheer, and i can see the outline of my bra in front. i will have to wear a cami underneath.",4,15/06/2018
"Fun, happy top!","Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy, and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side, but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small.",5,08/09/2018
Color and buttons,The buttons on the side give this top style. great color and fabric make it perfect paired with denim.,4,29/08/2018
Perfect but...,"I love this top! it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short. i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho, flowy look. it is flowy on it's own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size. waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation!",5,12/02/2018
Awkward sleeves,"I loved the way this top looked in stock photos. the colors are bright and cheery and it's a great transition piece. but the way the sleeves are cut almost makes them feel like water wings (if that makes sense)? they are stiff and wide and awkward. i've worn this a few times, hoping maybe the sleeves would relax down. they haven't. maybe it will look okay under a blazer for the office or something.",3,24/02/2018
Adorable!,"I thought i'd be the first to review for non -size- small ladies... i'm usually between a large and xl in retailer.  the large was great.. with room , as this top is pictured.  you'll love the details on this colorful, fun top ( ex: buttons on the side).  great with skinnies. i bought it on sale, but it really is a special top and worth the price.",5,01/08/2018
Love this top!,"Nice quality, details, and i like the looser cut (works well on this blouse).",5,04/06/2018
Mad for plaid,"I hesitated initially buying this because of the unique fit in the neckline and shoulders and because i have broad shoulders. but if you adjust the neck, sleeves and play with the overall fit of the shirt, it works. the boxy airy design has to be paired with something that flows with it (i.e. linen pants) or trusty denim. otherwise you may have a battle on your hands finding a complementary pairing!",4,21/10/2018
Very pink,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,2,24/11/2018
Tricky - would work on some people,"Such a cute plaid print, i couldn't resist ordering this but all of the petite sizes were sold out. i went with the xs based on other reviews and it was just too huge. i ended up returning it. i think the xs petite may have worked but it's sold out so i'll never know. it is boxy so you may need to be careful if that fit works for your body or not. the colors are magnificent.",4,20/04/2018
Could not resist this plaid!,"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#.",5,29/11/2018
Go to pattern,"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",5,18/03/2018
Darker in person,"The embroidery on this top is pretty but i think blue is more of a navy/grey in person and the embroidery seemed darker brown. i'm 5'6 and tried an xs and small, the small definitely fit better in length. the body of thr blouse is loose, almost boxy. cute top, just not what i'm looking for.",4,25/08/2018
Adorable take from the typical flannel!,Love this top b/c it's very feminine! got this at 20% off and it's very flattering!,5,25/09/2018
Cute and quirky,"This is a cute and quirky feminine top with the ruffle detailing and polka dot flannel inside the sleeve cuffs. i wish it was little longer and maybe not flannel, then it would be perfect, but overall i liked it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame (plus a relatively short torso) and the small fit throughout the shoulders and chest.",4,23/11/2018
"Nice colors, warm, but a bit boxy","So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast.
it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.

colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it",5,17/09/2018
Unfortunately didn't work in xl,"I ordered the xl and the colors are just as pictured. the material is so soft. the problems: too short and too small. i'm a little over 5 ft. 5 inches and this top ran so short on me. i wish there were three more inches of material and then it would have been great. it was cut a little tight along the shoulder line too. i was so disappointed that this couldn't work on me. i like a romantic style, especially for comfortable basics. but, this was a pass for me. i had to return it. the ruffles on t",4,22/10/2018
Loved it so much i bought a second!,"This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.",5,18/03/2018
Love it!,Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan,5,05/11/2018
Pretty,This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.,5,11/09/2018
Simply beautiful,"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!",5,12/10/2018
Pretty but lots of fabric,"I grabbed this during a 20% off sale so i will state first that i don't think this top is worth full price, and even at 20% off i wasn't wowed enough to pay that much for it. the colors are more saturated in person and very pretty. however, the cut- both the length and the width- just made it too overwhelming on my size 14/16 frame. i ordered the xl and it was wayyyy too big through the chest but sizing down to a large meant that it didn't flow over my hips as well because it's so long. i think",4,13/11/2018
Love this buttondown!,"Sorry, but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing, i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy, and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline, and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm",5,11/08/2018
Cute summer blouse,"This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re",5,10/06/2018
Sheer and runs large,"Saw this on the mannequin and tried it on just for kicks:
________
pros:
- breathable fabric, all cotton, with a lovely color.
________
cons:
- runs large, which is the style of the top anyhow. however, i was swimming in the medium (and i normally fit in size 10/12 or m/l tops with retailer stuff. you can easily size down and have plenty of room left. but if you like it really baggy, then stick with your normal size. for reference, i'm a 36c and hourglass and had ample room in a medium.
- s",3,23/11/2018
Runs a bit large,"And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....",2,08/09/2018
Meets all expectations,This shirt is really lovely. the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done. it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look.,5,16/07/2018
Super cute,"I, sadly, only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big, i would need the petite, so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs, 30dd) - but it is adorable, can be dressed up and classy, casually with jeans, or sweetly, so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well, i am sure i will find something similar i love!",5,08/08/2018
Cute shirt with unique pattern,"I love finding cute tops on sale that have great potential, but just need a little altering. i bought this one in my usual size medium and took it in 2 inches on both sides. it's still a looser fit, but much cuter. i didn't want to size down fearing it would be too tight in the shoulders and underarms. it's also a softer cotton fabric (similar to brushed cotton) rather than the crisp cotton most white button down shirts are made of.",4,03/02/2018
Belia peplum top,"I really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy. it's shorter in the front and longer in the back. the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled. it's definitely worth trying on, but didn't fit me.",3,23/06/2018
Love the 3/4 sleeves,"This is all around, a pretty feminine take on the white shirt- very cute! the dot pattern adds some drama without it being too over-board. this fit of this top is fairly generous (on me at least), but it doesn't have a lot of stretch. i could probably be either a s or xs, but took the xs to get more of a silhouette.",4,14/11/2018
Cute top,"Cute top, wish they had xxs. looks great with jeans and a fun necklace like pix. i got an xs (5'4 and 135 lbs) and it's still a little wider than i would prefer, but i'm not a skinny jeans gal so might look better with those. i decided to keep it since no xxs. wore all day with jeans for a more casual event, then added a skirt and high heels later for a theater show. super comfortable and looks great for all occasions.",4,24/07/2018
"Cute design, good quality but baggy & unflattering","Like a previous reviewer, i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots, so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops, however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t",3,10/03/2018
Flowy and feminine,This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.,5,18/09/2018
The key to cute fit is to size down,"I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate",5,03/06/2018
"Cute, great quality, nice fit","Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",5,29/04/2018
Too boxy,"I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same, boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.",3,21/02/2018
From a white shirt collector!,"I love white shirts and can never have enough in my closet. this one is gorgeous, and is way prettier in person than it looks on the model. it has a peplum bottom with sort of (but not quite)appliquã©d large polka dots all over. it is a pullover, so there are no buttons on the peplum. i normally wear xl in retailer tops unless they run very large. i tried on the large in the store and it fit but i knew if it shrank when i washed it i'd never be able to wear it again. i ordered the xl which came tod",5,06/12/2018
"Cute, alittle boxy","I was so excited for another fun white shirt. this was fits the bill! its cute, it does run alittle boxy maybe a hair large. it is also not white, white, has a touch of ivory. still, is a great top with skinny jeans. received a compliment yesterday while getting coffee, the lady was going online to get one for herself!",4,19/05/2018
Cut does not flatter,"Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.
i will be returning it.",3,25/05/2018
"Did not like the fit, but beautiful colors","I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame.",2,21/05/2018
So unflattering,"I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c",1,02/02/2018
Great fall colors,This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.,5,26/11/2018
Gooooorgeous,"These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!",5,30/03/2018
Busty? curvy? no problem!,"I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl",5,23/02/2018
Gorgeous!,"I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately!
it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details.
i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c.
loved it so reordered in a size large.
if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end
of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up)
the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med",5,28/02/2018
"Love style, not quality","The color of this top is lovely. however, i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.",3,05/03/2018
Lumpy on the sides,"Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.",2,26/01/2018
"Strange cut, pretty idea","I bought this in size xl and it ran small along the waist & bottom hemline. i'm pear-shaped so it's an awkward fit. i'll wear it tucked in or belted. they used a lot of material in the sleeves & through the top portion. i wish they hadn't made it such a narrow cut along the bottom.

the sleeves are very pretty. the embroidery they used for the cutouts is a little rough & scratchy. since i got it on sale & like the color, i'm keeping it. i recommend trying this on if you can.",4,19/10/2018
Beautiful blouse,"This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!",5,09/09/2018
Not for the full figured,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,1,05/05/2018
Love!,"This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8"") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!",5,13/06/2018
Beautiful,"Love, love this top. fabric is nice and soft, looks great with leggings. love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back.",5,02/10/2018
Cute top,Great top for everyday wear. runs a little large as i usually for size medium and i bought a small. a tiny bit see through but i think i can get away without wearing a tank underneath.,4,15/05/2018
"Yeh, what she said.....","Yep. this is snug, so maybe you might consider upping your normal size. but here's the annoying thing for me...the buttons fell off. not kidding. the first i wore this blouse and two buttons came off. when i looked at the other ones i saw that they all needed to be resewn to keep them attached. what a bother. but i'm doing it because the cotton poplin is nice and the little ruffle is a nice touch that i really like . where am i going to find another? so i'll fix it up the way it should have been",4,02/08/2018
Odd cut,"This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work, so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.",3,22/05/2018
Perfect,"Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall",5,08/12/2018
Surprisingly nice in person,"/my friend and i both tried on this shirt just to see how it fit and because it was blue. we were surprised how pretty it si on. a little see-through though, but hte cut hits in the right places (i guess we are not too endowed). she ended up buying it so i passed but very feminie work piece.",4,28/04/2018
Not for my body type,"Love this button down, but i couldn't make it work. i'm 5'4"", 32b, and usually buy tops in a regular xs or s. i bought this top in a small and it was loose fitting which i liked, but too long for me causing the pleats to flare out more than i liked. the shirt is also pretty sheer, wear a skin colored bra unless you want it noticed. the material was soft and looked like good quality.",4,03/03/2018
Very flattering fit,"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.",5,28/03/2018
Unique spin to classic button down,I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,5,15/10/2018
Fun & flirty take on preppy look,"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!",5,29/08/2018
Perfect fit for broad shoulders,"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",5,02/03/2018
Absolute steal at sale price,"This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu",5,30/07/2018
Great basic,I really like this shirt. the material was a little heavier cotton than i expected in looking at the picture which is good otherwise it could look like you slept in the shirt. it is something that is going to wrinkle when you wear it so if that is bothersome then pass on this shirt. it's a bit longer which i also like because it will work by itself or under a jacket or sweater.,4,24/11/2018
Gorgeous top! but difficult zipper...,"I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality.

Really interesting blouse; very happy w/ purchase,"Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops, and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however, i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me, but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't",5,26/07/2018
Color is spectacular!,Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!,5,04/08/2018
A real beauty!,This top is gorgeous! it's a nice weight and the cami that comes with it makes it drapes nicely. i'll have to send it back though because it's too big. i'm always a medium but in this i'll be a small. :(,4,02/03/2018
Shrank when washed,"I loved this tunic the first time i wore it. i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my post-pregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots - just what i wanted. it fit true to size, even with a few extra pounds around the chest area. imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash - having followed the directions on the tag exactly - and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly. in particular the sleeves became incredibly, uncomfortably tight and much sh",2,04/10/2018
Beautiful and comfortable,"Absolutely love this top! yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering, especially with skinny jeans. loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and the xs fit well (falls just above my mid thigh).",5,23/03/2018
Perfect!,"Love love love this tunic. it has panels that don't really show up in the picture but the panels make it lay really nice. it's great over leggings and skinny jean cords. could even wear it with opaque tights. it's great for work, play or evening. i bought the navy blue with the heart print. i love it so much i'll probably get the green and the red when they go on sale. this is a pricey top. for reference i'm 5""3 128lbs. 32ddd fits great all the way around and the length is perfect - mid-thigh an",5,17/07/2018

Unique and fun piece!,"I feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away. this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop... stylish, unique and beautiful. it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased.",5,11/09/2018
Embroidery love,"I gave this top 5 stars for the embroidery and fit around the chest/shoulders. i wish this top was a little longer as the xsmall was just too short. (i'm 5'6"" and run long-waisted.) the small fit better in length...the way it does on the model.",5,31/08/2018

Not flattering on me,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,1,28/08/2018
"Beautiful, but not for me","The picture is not a good representation of the cut and the fabric. the cut is a-line, trapezoid-shaped. the shirt is smallest in the shoulders and chest and then it flairs out to the sides. the cut works with pants mostly, you have to tuck the shirt in if wearing with skirts. the lace back drapes beautifully and is a little longer than the front, which again lend to wearing with skinny pants and such.
the fabric has a quality of freshly starched. pleasant surprise. it lacks softness of leisure",4,24/09/2018
Love it,It is a little roomy so if you're between sizes go with the smaller. i think it's flattering even if you have a larger chest. love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality!,5,24/11/2018
"Horrible quality, no structure",I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,1,25/01/2018
I lovethis blouse,"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",5,30/10/2018
Runs small in the bust,"This top is very cute, but i found it runs small in the bust, which is unusual for maeve. i will have to return it. you may want to size up, if you have a generous bust.",3,26/10/2018
Gorgeous print poor fit,"I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous, i could not wait. when i tried it on, it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure, just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.",3,17/04/2018
Loved the blouse,"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)

probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing""",2,11/02/2018
Loose and unflattering,"I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.",1,24/06/2018
Not for the busty,"Pros: pretty, nicely made.

cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.",3,08/12/2018
Delicate yet boxy,"Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.",5,01/10/2018
Lovely print...,"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/",5,24/06/2018
Gorgeous top,"Finally a top that fits true to size, is comfortable, and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer. i cannot recommend this top more! if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too. perfect fall transition top.",5,18/06/2018
Gorgeous,"Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).",5,17/08/2018
Pretty top,"I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am 5'9. it is a great fit, but it is a little sheer. i will probably have to wear a cami underneath.",5,27/04/2018
This is the best shirt!,I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.,5,29/04/2018
So pretty!,Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with,5,21/07/2018
Poor design,"If you have anything larger than an a cup, this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower, it would have been perfect. for reference, i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.",2,01/06/2018
Maeve never disappoints!,"This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed, so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days, but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!",5,08/08/2018
White is completely see through!,"Very cute shirt, but the white is see through. i could see every detail on my bra. i returned for the pink, which is just as cute.",4,08/07/2018
Perfect white top!,"While the blue color pictured is stunning, i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail, especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next, this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque, but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!",5,30/01/2018
"Tickled, tickled, tickled!!!","Yep, absolutely tickled to death with this top. light, airy, cotton poplin with personality plus. such an aesthetically pleasing piece! i haven't been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time! this blouse speaks to me...i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the size eight was a tad large-might have gotten a six but this is fine. it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says 'belt' or 'tuck' anyway! the neckline is just too much! it gives such personality to the piece. the open ne",5,06/09/2018
"Beautifully made, quality top","I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it, which is a rarity, since everything goes on sale. it's a beautify top, well made and sits well on me. i am 5'6"", usually wear a size 10 but got away with an 8 in this one. i do have short torso, so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone who's tall. what's even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back. i'm thinking about getting the other two colors",5,29/01/2018
"Beautiful color, short waist","This shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line, but unfortunately i had to send it back. it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back. had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out, but based on the length on me, it ended up looking like a shrunken tent. for reference, i am 5'8 with a long torso.",3,10/02/2018
Amnesty hi-lo tunic:,I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,5,03/10/2018
Super cute,"I bought this tunic is blue. it is now one of my favorite tops to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings. i have always love rayon. this top did not disappoint me. it feels very soft and silky which makes it perfect for warmer days. for reference i am 5""1' 125 lbs, the xs p fits me just like the model...lose and not too long. i love it so much that i am considering another in different color.",5,31/07/2018
Lovely rayon blouse,"Flattering cut, perfect for work or play. even better yet, it was on sale! if they had it in other colors i would buy it! beautiful high-quality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer!!!",5,16/02/2018
Easy elegance,"This top is fantastic. something about it has an ease of elegance and grace. the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear. i feel immediately put together and ready for anything. the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away. i purchased the off-white - it is a bit see-through, but i don't mind wearing a cami underneath.",5,21/02/2018
Nice enough,"I had been looking for an off the shoulder top (or open shoulder) as the trend is really in right now, but that proves more difficult for me (muscular traps and shoulders, not always flattering)... anyway, i decided to order this ( i saw it paired with a wide-leg jeans, tucked in)... that is how i like it... tucked in. it is otherwise a little boxy on me (wide shoulders means the whole thing shifts out. the fabric si a tiny bit wrinkle-prone, but not too badly. both colors are nice, but thought",4,28/07/2018
So close,"I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder, like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however, the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top, you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.",3,23/05/2018
Cute trendy top,"I love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way, i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer. looks great with faded jeans. i love the poplin fabric, although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this won't hold up long enough to wear again next summer. for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better. i am narrow shoulder'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o",3,23/09/2018
Cute plaid top with a feminine cut,"I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite, i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece, as many reviewers have n",3,17/07/2018
Great shirt!,"I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy, so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well, hang dry, easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!",5,02/09/2018
Favorite new plaid,"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",5,08/12/2018
Cute fall/holiday top,"Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy, which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!",5,23/11/2018
Cute and comfy,"This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.",5,27/03/2018
Perfect for everyday,"I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!",5,09/11/2018
Love this top,Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.,5,28/05/2018
Comfy and flattering,"Tis is a soft, soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute. it's a great top to use put on and go. i'm looking forward to wearing it often!",5,28/03/2018
Very cute!,"After reading other people's reviews, i was afraid it might be too long. i ordered the regular xs as all the petite a were sold out. i found the length to be perfect and i am only 5'2"".",4,04/11/2018
Love it!,Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.,5,20/06/2018
Super soft,"Super light and soft. haven't worn it out but expect to wear with jeans. it will be cute and comfy. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs and bought a small, fits well.",5,02/07/2018
Sad :(,"I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also, this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.",2,18/05/2018
Love how it looks but doesn't hold up,"I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.
but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(",2,12/09/2018
Great design but execution is meh.....,"I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully, the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also, there were a lot of thread h",3,07/05/2018
"Xl fits small, light blue is pretty","I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer. 

i would",2,14/10/2018
Wanted to love it,"Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail-- (i don't know why most designers overlook the back??). huge disappointment-- the back is totally plain, not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isn't even the same material as the front. it's almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment. it was a very sad return! i usually love this brand, this was just a quality control oversight i guess.",2,05/10/2018
Item is not as shown.,"Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.",1,20/10/2018
Cute buttondown; runs large,Looks great with skinny jeans or even white pants. i have wider hips (usually an 8 or 10 on bottom) and narrower shoulders (small or medium on top). i bought the medium and probably should have sized down to the small as this was a little large on me but the top still looked good being oversized. i am a 34b and did not have any issues with button gap. my only negative is that the material wrinkles easily. the floral detail on both the pocket and the sleeves is a nice touch.,4,30/09/2018
Lovely top; size down,"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back, and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down.

i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck",5,06/05/2018
Strange armhole construction,"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",2,17/11/2018
Beautiful tunic!,"I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.",5,16/06/2018
I don't want no scrubs...,Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone,3,23/07/2018

Lovely fabric,"The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de",5,28/01/2018
So beautiful,"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",5,30/09/2018

Amazing silk blouse,"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes, it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only"", you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be.",5,22/09/2018
Not for me,"The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes), but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though, because it's a pretty shirt and different.",3,14/11/2018
Not as pictured,"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up.",3,04/07/2018

Fun top,"This top is cute. i got the mint coloured one and like it. with that said, the sewing however is a bit off. the bottom of the top is angled. there is no mention of that in the description so it is safe to say it is not part of the design. it is not tremendously noticeable,  but i noticed it. i will still keep this top, coz i can camouflage that defect with a cardigan.  it is sheer, so if you are wearing it for work without cover, a camisole would be required or a nude bra. i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and",4,10/03/2018

Very cute,This is a great little top. colors are beautiful and more vibrant in real life. ordered size large and the fit is the same as the model. you could probably size down. armholes are a bit large but am picky about that area and i can work with it. the body flows but it's not huge and is slimming. the high neck and tie are darling. will be cute under a sweater or jacket as weather cools. good buy on sale.,4,20/06/2018

Nice top!,"This top is so cute! it does run big. i am usually a small/med in most tops and i fit a xsmall. i am short waist with a 38c bust. it looks great with white jeans, boyfriend jeans or just shorts. dress it up or down! love it!",4,18/09/2018
Too billowy,This was really billowy but not in a good way. i had to return it. looks great in the photo but not so much in person.,3,25/03/2018
On the fence,"The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn't fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!

colors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri",3,23/04/2018
Too big,"I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5'10"". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t",4,28/03/2018
Too cute to pass up!,"Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i'm not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd 'smoky'-like odor, but it's the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr",5,13/04/2018
Runs small,"I loved this top, however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone, however their products do run a size small.",4,29/04/2018
Surprised this shirt is still available !,This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth,5,30/04/2018
"Great shirt, excellent details","I am so glad i waited for this to go on sale! this shirt is incredibly soft, with great detail on the fading. i ordered a medium (5'10"", 160 lbs) and it fits perfectly.",5,31/03/2018
Great take on a classic!,"I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.",5,02/09/2018
Cute,"Very comfortable and flattering top, but runs a bit large. i am usually a medium and fit comfortably into the small. the blue stripes are not see through, however i saw  the black motif in stores and it's definitely see through.",4,05/10/2018
"Cute fabric, but odd cut","I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10"", and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model, and the cut was just too wide under the armpits.",3,24/02/2018
"Great top, but needs undershirt","I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.",5,23/10/2018
"Travel, weekends, work, go anywhere top.","I am 34dd. bought sz med and have plenty of room up top. the black motif is really a dark, purple/blue. slightly sheer. the length on the med is 251/4 from bottom of collar (the collar adds 1 1/4"") the length does not cover my bum like the model , covers 2/3rds, nor does it appear as long in front.",4,08/07/2018
Could have been executed better,"First, i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics. 


what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that, although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin",3,20/07/2018
Nice summer top,"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.",5,23/08/2018
Love the back,Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!,5,11/02/2018
Beautiful!,"This shirt is more beautiful in person. it has a lovely hand feel (soft) and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant. i bought it for my 13 year old niece. she loved it! she may have to return for a small, but i do feel the size ran true to size. it depends on how you want to wear it.",5,06/03/2018
Plaid and dye fun,"I am a huge fan of cloth and stone tops as they are very versatile.
this particular one didn't disappoint. the combination of plaid and tie dye is so fun and fresh, yet the blue makes this piece an easy one to match with many bottoms.

now for the fit:
the cotton is very soft and lightweight.
i bought my normal size medium and it fits perfectly.

i look forward to wearing this piece often.",5,21/05/2018
Love,"This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.",5,10/07/2018
Not for me,"Although the fabric and color is beautiful,  the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.",3,05/07/2018
"Beautiful top, but not on me","This top is gorgeous: beautiful lace, substantial fabric, great color. but it looked so weird on me. i have broader shoulders, and the sleeves did not drape on me like they do on the model, they just stuck straight out. as another reviewer mentioned, the fabric is stiff. i didn't want to size up because the body and length both fit well. perhaps if you have smaller/ rounded shoulders this top will hang better. for reference i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs, and tried a size s.",3,03/03/2018
So wanted to love.....,"I saw this top online and ordered immediately!
i loved the color, lace, and unique details.
sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!
the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.
the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....

it could have been fantastic, if the lace was softer, and some a",1,04/09/2018
Cutest top ever,The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.,5,18/10/2018
Gorgeous green,"I'm 5'9"" and 155lb. i have been wearing small a but this was realllllly small especially at my arms. it made me look like i was taking off... much more beautiful on the model. a medium would e been too big on my torso. the color is amazing! made my blonde hair really pop. i don't love green but this was so different.  would love to find something else in this color that suits me! you need to be a super skinny waif to look good in this!",3,07/05/2018
Soft and lovely,This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!,5,10/02/2018
Wanted to love,I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.,3,04/10/2018
Beautiful boho top,"Love this top , although it ran very small in bust and arms , i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!",3,09/05/2018
Great date top,"This top is a classic subtle sexy top, great for casual wear and especially to go on a date. the hem of the sleeves have a slit, neat detail. small fit me well width wise but sleeves are too long (2 in. pass my wrist) but i cannot roll them up because the bell shape does not hold and i cannot hem them because they would lose the original stitching (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist). no petite size so i passed. cloth and stone is better in making petite size but not for most items, sad for us shorties.",4,26/06/2018
Staple top,"I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft, great fabric, a cute cut, and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!",5,24/08/2018
Great shirt,Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.,5,23/04/2018
Perfect white shirt,"This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough, unflattering shape, too masculine, too boring, too wrinkly, or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter, but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple, plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me, year round. i have other cloth & stone tops, and have loved them all. their",5,15/11/2018
So soft and amazing,"I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.

the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.",5,01/09/2018
Elegant and casual at the same time,"This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,",5,07/07/2018
Nice but too big,"I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. i ordered a m and it was far too boxy and long in the arms as well as the back. the collar is small and lays flat. the material is good quality and soft but heavier than i had hoped.",3,04/12/2018
"Tight sleeves, overly blousy top","The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy, too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.",3,14/09/2018
Perfect for fall!,Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!,5,20/02/2018
Perfect,"Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4"", 138#.  even at my age it looks great.",5,12/08/2018
Test like fit,"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",1,11/11/2018
A fresh take on flannel!,"I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple, but i don't own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down, which simply does not work for me, given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it's not flattering. this top is flannel, no buttons, and off the shoulder, which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put",5,02/11/2018
Love it!,"What a great, soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.",5,02/02/2018
Burgandy plaid beauty,"The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.",5,07/03/2018

Sexy,"Love this top. i'm athletic, it's a little tight around the arms. but it's a really nice looking blouse off and on!",5,05/10/2018
Great off the shoulder top,Off the shoulder is everywhere and this is a great shirt for the fall.,5,11/07/2018
New favorite top,The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way. i get tons of compliments each time i wear this.,5,24/02/2018
Off the shoulder trend continues for the fall,"This top is really pretty. the fabric is soft and flowy (not too boxy) and the elastic at the top is comfortable. it does not ride up or fall off the shoulders, which i've found with tops of similar design. in my regular size s (5'6 - 125lb), i didn't find the sleeves tight like others have mentioned. one thing i did notice was that the hidden straps that many other tops and dresses have (the ones for hanging on a hanger) are sewn right on the edge of the upper elastic making them pop up a bit.",4,06/03/2018
Fabric looks cheap,I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.,1,08/10/2018

Besutiful,Love this top!!!! it is just gorgeous and fits great!,5,25/05/2018
Oversized and unstructured but soft,"I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.",1,28/03/2018
Soft and sweet,I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!,5,26/07/2018
A super soft shirt,"I was so excited to see this shirt in petite sizing. for reference, i am 5' 2"" / 105 lbs / 32a chest, with a thin but athletic build.  i love the feel of this shirt. it is made from a tencil blend that gives it a nice weight and drape. because i don't have much of a chest, i do think it is a bit low-cut on me. i will probably wear a cami underneath next time. 
it is a pretty, versatile dress up or down kind of piece, which is why i chose it. i gave it a four star rating only because it is ama s",4,13/05/2018

Must have item for summer,"Hi there, 
if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft, a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better), and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans, and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized, but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so, if you are ti",5,05/03/2018
Nice design but too sheer,Loved the idea of this but content felt too thin and sheer.,3,11/08/2018
Versatile shirt,"Bought this in the white. i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps. i typically vacillate between a m and l, and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large, which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long.

the fabric is soft, and the weight of this shirt is season-less; always a plus. it is not sheer by any means, but if you have a tattoo (like i do) you will be able to see it.

Nice staple with a twist,"This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.",5,08/03/2018
Doesn't breath,"The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.",2,08/11/2018
Not for me,I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.,2,14/09/2018
Great shirts,"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'",5,10/07/2018
Photo does not do this justice,"1. i agree with the other reviewer. the photos do not do this shirt justice. it's very cute and fits well. the photos on the models are terrible.

2. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size medium fit me perfectly. i'm often in between a m and l for cloth and stone, but the medium fit well, which means it runs a little big.

3. i wanted a plain white shirt with a little interest, and the side buttons add that. it also means this is not a tuck in shirt, but more of a tunic.",4,16/06/2018
Blah,"I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt, it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.",3,31/01/2018
Soft button down,"I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment, like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips, typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before, and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li",3,03/11/2018
Perfect white button down,"First, this picture does not do this shirt justice. in fact, the hanger does not do this shirt justice. you must try this shirt on! it drapes so well. not as soft as some cloth & stone tops, but it is still very soft. the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up. there's no pockets, which is nice in a button down. it drapes in a very flattering way. i've never been happier with a cloth&stone garment. i normally wear a small in this brand, and that is true for this top as well. however,",5,09/08/2018
So soft. so cute.,"I adore this top. it is super soft, drapes nicely, and looks great with a ton of different bottoms. i am 5'4"", 104 lbs., and ordered this in both xs (my usual size), and s. i ended up keeping the s (most cloth & stone xs tops swim on me, so i was a little surprised), but glad i tried both. my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it. it is a gauze-like material, and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top.",5,10/08/2018
Super soft but runs small,"I love the fabric of this shirt -- it's super soft. however the fit is off -- i'm normally a medium and the buttons across the chest were gaping open when buttoned (never a problem for me, i'm a 34b and not very busty). it is also a bit on the short side, especially when the general trend is toward longer shirts/tunics. i would recommend sizing up (in fact i'm going to try this in a large, fingers crossed...)",4,04/09/2018
Adorable,"This top is well made and fits me like a glove. i am only 5'1"" but have a very muscular build. the xs fits perfectly--slimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms. the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel.",5,03/06/2018
Much more than a flannel shirt,"I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.",5,09/06/2018
"Cozy, soft shirt","I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.",5,07/06/2018

Great fall top,This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.,5,26/11/2018

Poor quality,"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand, but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better, but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute, but the qua",3,26/08/2018

Love this shirt,"I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms, so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long, but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3"", 130 lbs, a cup, 17"" across the shoulders.",5,10/03/2018

Not for large chests,"This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.

Comfy lounging top,"I was looking for a flannel-y buttondown that i could wear with leggings or skinny jeans, and this definitely fits the bill. i like the cute details like the contrast collar and cuffs, and also the slight back pleat and the curved hemline. i'm not crazy about the colorways that are offered, but the pink is cute enough, and as other reviewers mentioned, i find the quality a little lacking. i'd be very happy with this shirt on sale, but not sure about it at full price. i got a size s (5'4"", 120 lb",4,18/05/2018

A welcome sight for my fall wardrobe,"This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes. i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it. it is unlike any fabric i've ever had: a soft two-ply, almost gauzy cotton. one cute detail is that the ""inside"" layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer. so cute! and so soft! one thickness above cheesecloth, i would say. and like cheesecloth, it has a natural ""give"" within the weave, but it is not stretchy. the shoulders",5,28/03/2018
Love it! i wish they had it in more colors,"I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt, she hated it.  well, i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener, and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt, but a soft casual shirt, and as i said before, i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it, even straight out of the dryer.  (i own the yellow and pink!)",5,27/01/2018
Cute fall staple,"The color is a very dark mustard yellow, thin/light-weight material, and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m, i recommend the size up for hip fit.",4,20/05/2018
Skinny arms...,"I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes, this is a cute shirt, if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but, my arms aren't even big, and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(",3,16/07/2018
Wonderful fall button-down,"Glad i went in to buy this: in store i was surprised by the texture which was much more cotton (almost gauze-like) than most cloth & stone shirts made with tencel. the blue looks like demin online but in person is a rather ugly dark blue, the pink was almost red, but the yellow was beautiful!
it is double-lined which is one of the best things about it. 
i'm usually between a s and m and could have gone either way but choose m because it was a little longer and ""flowy-er"".",4,28/09/2018
Love this brand,"Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down, i have to buy it. fit is always so flattering, comfy and the prints are always great!",5,08/05/2018
Ackerley blouse in yellow,"Love this blouse in yellow! fit is true to size, and it looks a feels great.",5,07/12/2018
Vibrant! small!,"Tried this on at the store after falling in love with the color scheme and cut. tons of compliments from the dressing room ladies-this is a hot item in colorado apparently! was surprised that my regular size-small-was too tight in the shoulders, armpits, and upper arms, and i'm not big! (5'7,"" 140 lbs., 32d) ended up with with a medium. 100% cotton so i won't be machine drying this cuz it looks prone to shrinkage. too casual to wear to work but it'll be fun to run errands, etc. in this for at le",4,28/10/2018
Perfect fall shirt,"Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color, but i still like it.",5,03/11/2018
"Um, perfect if you have toothpicks for arms","So this shirt is adorable. soft, fun, lays nicely...
but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie's before you put it on. 
i don't even have large arms, the medium fit me perfectly, but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams. this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection. 

i mean, i'm not a large? but i guess if i want this shirt, i will need to take it back and get a large, otherwise, it will be sleev",3,27/10/2018
Fun fall plaid,Very comfortable and cute. true to size. a look for three seasons.,5,25/11/2018
Cute tunic to throw on and go,"This tunic is simple and well made. it was not as long as on the model as on me but i am 5'-9"".",3,14/11/2018
Super soft and relaxed,"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.
this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b",5,11/03/2018
Very nice!,"This top works very well with a white or green cardigan for work. the color is more green than in the photo and it is wider on the bottom. it hides a non-flat stomach very well without looking matronly. i ordered a small petite, but i am heavy on top so i did not find the armhole problem that the other reviewer had. my only con is that i don't love the high-low thing that every retailer top seems to have these days, but i can live with it.",4,03/11/2018
"Runs large, muted colors","I bought this tank for work, but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs, 5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose, which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist, and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though, not to heavy and not too thin.",3,06/05/2018
Versatile,"This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.",5,10/02/2018
Favorite everyday shirt!,Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co,5,09/02/2018
Updated white shirt,First tried on a large but wanted a little more room which an xl gave me. it is just what i wanted to update my wardrobe.,4,15/07/2018
Time will tell,"This is a cute top although it runs fairly large. i have washed it once and the fray did ok; however, i'm a bit concerned about how the shirt will wash over time with the frayed edges.",4,04/07/2018
"""beach business""","Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.",5,24/03/2018
From a petite - love this shirt,"It's a little roomy, but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one, whether worn with jeans, work pants, or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said, the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me, i love that, as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny, tiny petite, but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.",5,14/09/2018
Staple buttondowns,A must for every closet. very flattering fit - although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray.,5,02/10/2018
Perfect white blouse,"I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it's loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans, booties, simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.",5,30/09/2018
A nice twist on a classic,"I love the cut of this shirt! interesting back, and it hangs nicely.....surprisingly flattering! i'm usually a small and needed the xs in this shirt, fyi. very soft, and overall just very pleased with this purchase! i bought it in the denim as well!",5,25/06/2018
"Beautiful shirt, great fabric, seam come undone :(","This shirt flows beautifully and the fabric is almost wrinkle free. i also love that it's the perfect weight and not too low cut, and that the buttons are covered. however, the stitching started to come undone the first time a wore it! i didn't even wash the shirt yet. sadly, i don't think i can recommend this shirt, though maybe give it a try- i might have got a defective one. oh this shirt also seems to run a bit large through the body, but it still looks great. i hope this helps!",3,19/08/2018
Top is too shear with see through front,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,2,19/04/2018
Not for the broad shouldered,"Loved everything about this top except two things: the price (there is a lot of pretty detail though) and the shoulders. what is not depicted in the stock photos is how wide the shoulder ruffles are...i have an athletic build at 5'7"", 140 lbs and 32dd and this top unfortunately made me look like a football player. i ordered a small and the fit was perfect. beware that this top is on the shorter side. it really is very pretty but i would steer away if you have athletic or broad shoulders.",4,02/06/2018
Very sheer,"A beautiful blouse;however, i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also, and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.",3,20/09/2018
Cute but see through,I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.,3,18/02/2018
Thin lightweight and sheer,"Personally i love cloth and stone. . this top however sheer is still a nice top to have in my rotation. it is thin, lightweight, and sheer but with a cami or nude bra can be pulled off nicely.. i did find the top to be tts for me but the sleeves were snug. i purchased this on sale with extra 30 percent off so i was justified in getting it..",4,20/07/2018
Great transition from work to evening,"It's lightweight, which is perfect for summer officewear when i don't want bare arms. my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer. this shirt is sheer but not as much as most, in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheer-ness. i don't find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly, i've worn it to work with a nude bra, and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour. i went a size up to a small becaus",5,04/08/2018
Too sheer,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.",2,21/08/2018
Great for summer blouse,"Yes it is thin but a great summer blouse. the body runs true to size, but the sleeves are tight..i may try to size up so the sleeves can be more comfortable.",4,12/06/2018
Love it!!,"I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable, without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic, yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer, making it that much more comfo",5,02/09/2018
Beautiful but extremely see thru,"The design is gorgeous, the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however, it's extremely see thru.",2,09/07/2018
Adorable!,"I wore this top recently and received several compliments. it's a great top with the off the shoulder trend, plus you can wear a normal bra underneath! runs large so i recommend one size down.",5,04/10/2018
Love the polka dots,Very comfortable. fits true to size. i also have this in white. fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable. shirt is very flattering. the polka dots add a playful touch. super cute.,5,02/08/2018
Great casual shirt,I love this shirt because it's casual yet fun! the first time i wore it i received several compliments because of the fun tassels.,4,05/09/2018
How fun,"I love the cut of this top, it flares out nicely, and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail, not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice, i didn't try petite or xxs, just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good. (115 lbs, 30dd chest)",5,14/08/2018
Favorite summer top!,"I absolutely love this top! it is soft, comfortable and perfectly flowy. this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top.",5,30/05/2018
Summer time blues,Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,5,13/11/2018
So cute,"This top is great! it looks much better in person. it's still kind of a faded look but it's not as light as shown here. also, the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice, loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.",5,19/09/2018
Nautical style!,"Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i can't wait to take it out for a spin!

i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!",5,26/06/2018
Great top!,"I just received this top and love it. the fabric is soft and comfy. it is just as pictured, no surprises. lace-up fronts are a hot item for spring. for reference, i am 5'7 and weigh #127. the xs fits perfectly.",5,15/06/2018
Cute but big,"This top was always on my wait for sale list, now it is and i had to pass. i love the look on other people, the laec up is super cute and trendy, but the cut was just too big on me. it left me blah. i think if you are tall and are looking for a nice white shirt, then go for it, it looks so nice half tucked with skinny jeans...",4,21/03/2018
Xs is still too big :(,"Love this top, but the xs is still way too big, swallows me. 5'1"" petite. wish it came in a petite offering. sadly, had to return this item.",4,15/03/2018
Fits well,"I'm 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fits perfectly. the sleeves are the right length (i have long arms and legs), and the body fits loosely, without looking sloppy. at my height, the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic, which is fine.

unfortunately, the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt, so i had to wash it before wearing it.

i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale.",3,09/03/2018
Perfect,"This is an awesome blouse! it is well made. the fabric is thick and soft. it drapes beautifully. i love the tie at the top. i wish it came in other colors - other than the denim offered. i am 5'4"", 115 pounds, flat chested. the xs fit well.",5,23/10/2018
Perfect in every way,Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,5,31/10/2018
Nice drape!,"I love this top! although, i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium. i am 5'4"", 138 pounds and a 34d. the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders. it will work; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home.",4,01/08/2018
So soft,"Love this henely, the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans",5,12/06/2018
Love it!,It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly.,5,24/01/2018
Classic,"This shirt fits beautifully, though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft, and the look classic and feminine.",5,15/04/2018
Comfy and classy,"This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.",5,23/11/2018
Perfect white blouse,I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.,5,17/09/2018
Summer top,"The color of this top is perfect for summer, it is a light lilac tone. the fabric is also light and super soft. great cut too - even my husband liked the cut of the shirt. 

i ordered a large based on other reviews but found the arms to be a little tight, but not enough not to keep the top. the shirt does run slim, being a 36d i do have to keep the top buttons unbutton but i am okay with wearing a little cami under the shirt.",4,27/07/2018
Love this top!,"I'm so glad i bought this. the picture doesn't do it justice. it's lightweight, flowy and super comfy. i'll be wearing this all the time. very lightweight so it doesn't get hot. love the material, it's soft, light and flattering! color says light grey but it does have a bit of a blue/lavender hue to it as another reviewer said. i love cloth & stone and this is one of my favorites! well worth the money!",5,14/07/2018
Slim great material,"I love the color, it has a lavender hue. it's slightly see-through, but breathes nicely and is very soft and comfortable. it falls long in the back and fits slim through the torso.",4,07/08/2018
Falls to the back.,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 143 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32 -40 and the medium fit me well.

2. my only problem is that the collar keeps falling to the back. i feel like the shoulder isn't cut right to sit on the shoulder. i seem to have this problem a lot with this brand, where the shirt just wants to fall to the back.",4,08/03/2018
Runs big,"This is a beautiful blouse however it runs big. i order the small and had to return it. my measurements are 5'4 135 34c-28-38 for reference. you will not regret buying this blouse but it has to be the right size if not it would look like it did on me, frumpy. i kept taking it off and putting it back on trying to make it work (because i liked the material that much) but if you look at the model she has her arms straight down. when i lifted my arms i had 3 inches of extra material on both side. th",4,01/05/2018
Favorite shirt,"Best part: covers my bum. perfect for teaching, casual girls' night or casual date night.  my only complaint is there aren't other colors. awful decision. i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price.",5,02/08/2018
True to size,"This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.

same fabric as my other cloth and stone items, however, i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also, the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way, which i like.",5,02/11/2018
Snag this before it's gone!,"Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. 

super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!

for reference i'm 5'6"" 103lbs 34a 25 in jeans and i tried on an xs. last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa",5,31/08/2018
Cute top but very uncomfortable,"The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has
almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as
movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!",1,23/05/2018
So so pretty,"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",5,09/11/2018
Adorable!,Just bought this top in an xs and i can&amp;#39;t wait to wear it.  i&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;3 and 115 pounds. i usually stick with the petitie tops but the regular one fit me perfectly. you might need to wear a cami as it is a little see through.  a great addition to my wardrobe.,5,20/02/2018
"Nice drape, lovely navy","I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",5,05/10/2018
"Beautiful color, nice fabric but ..","When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated, as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well, i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik",3,17/08/2018
Soft and comfortable while dressing up or down,The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.,5,22/11/2018
Perfect fit,"This top is exactly what i was looking for. rich olive color and very versatile. great as a lightweight jacket, casual or dressed up button up. i purchased a medium and it fits great. 5'7"", broad shoulders, narrow waist, and full hips.",5,30/06/2018
Great staple shirt,"I love this shirt - it is very soft, and has a nice cut and drape. fits true to size. wish there were more colors!",5,28/08/2018
Great staple piece!,"I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room.",5,29/11/2018
So soft and cuddly!,"I am 5'5"" normally about 120lb, but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes, even though they might not fit me currently! however, because this shirt is drapey, it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!",5,20/06/2018
Order a size down,I know what you're thinking- the review below this says 'runs small.' not true. i am a size 4 fitted top and ordered a size small at first. it arrived and was really boxy and so big it wasn't flattering in any way. i ordered the xsmall because i really wanted this top to work. the fabric quality is amazing. so soft and strong! the xsmall is definitely a better fit but the cut is still a little boxy by nature. it's an excellent high quality chambray shirt if you're in the market!,4,04/02/2018

Coolest shirt ever,The print is awesome !,5,13/02/2018
Love this top!,"This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue, and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine, just larger and even more roomy), but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans, flats, leather boots, o",5,09/04/2018
Unbelievably soft,"This has been my go to top for cooler days, so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10, 36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size, but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.",5,06/11/2018
Disappointing for the price,"The cut of this piece is great, the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing, let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.",1,11/11/2018

Soft halter top for longer waist,"This chambray halter top is a good summer staple from cloth and stone, but, it is better for longer waists than mine (and, smaller busts). 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist - normally i wear a m in c&s, and that is what i tried in this halter top.
oddly the overall length was okay, but the armholes were very low. in the m, the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top. i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice. in other words, the top ha",4,23/03/2018
Beautiful tank,"When you order online, you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers, i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral, cream, green, and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however, i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes, order down.",5,30/09/2018
A sweet embroidered top,"I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon, not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right, not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special, this is the top for you!",5,01/05/2018
Beautiful detail,"I am in love with this top! i saw it online, and i was a bit nervous to order it because it's a little pricy for a tank top, and i was worried it was going to be too short on me. i was so wrong! the detail on the top is so beautiful, and looks even better in person! it hit me right at mid hip, and looks so cute with jeans and sandals. i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms, but this top is",5,21/06/2018
Great purchase,"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.",5,26/02/2018
Versatile off the shoulder,"Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile, comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay, and without a doubt, this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect, summery shade, but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7, shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad, and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir",5,02/11/2018
A great off the shoulder top that ......wait...,"It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty",5,10/05/2018
"Cute, but boxy","I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however, it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale, i may purchase it again, but i did end up returning the shirt.",3,15/02/2018
Great everyday shirt with a twist,"This shirt has much less color variation in person (online it appears vaired, imo). in person it is a darker classic charcoal grey with little to no color variation.
----------
this shirt is very soft, of medium weight, and fits tts. the buttons down the back of the shirt are functional, and the backside pleating ensures you don't show too much skin if you opt to leave one or two unbuttoned.

Perfect flowy go to top,"For reference i am 5'7"", 145lbs, 34b normally a size m/6. i got the med and it ftt size. i ordered this online and it came a bit wrinkled so i'm hoping once i iron it out it won't be a problem when i am wearing it. i was looking for a nice flowy tunic-like shirt that was flattering but nothing too constricting. this is the perfect length for me to wear with leggings which is what i was looking for. it is longer in the back (covers my bottom) which is what i wanted and shorter in the front...the",4,10/10/2018
"Soft, long shirt that will go great with leggings","I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.",5,03/03/2018
Soft light fabric,"This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon, so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.
i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..
for reference, i am 5'5"", 125 lb., but have broad shoulders, making my usual best size a medium in most tops and",5,30/11/2018
Much cuter in person,"I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i didn't feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue",5,03/09/2018
Appealing color,I've received so many complements on this top. it's so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color. i ordered it in each color!,5,01/03/2018
Loved this shirt - but only in navy,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,5,16/11/2018
Perfect denim top,"A beautiful classic!
love the denim fabric in such a pretty style.
this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics.
the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering.
ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly........very true to size.",5,02/10/2018
Pretry top,"Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out.",5,13/10/2018
"Beautiful, but scratchy","My firned tried this on and her first comment was ""take it off, it is scratchy"", so i didn't bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.
fit was true to size.",3,14/08/2018
Not impressed...,"Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...",3,29/01/2018
Fair,The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!,3,20/09/2018
Great colors but....,"I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that's out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.",3,21/08/2018
Beautiful colors,This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.,5,30/04/2018
Vibrant metallic,"This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn't as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i'm 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i'd recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i'm a 34d) so it's not work appropriate. .",4,13/09/2018
"Scratchy, uncomfortable top","The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

Yes it's scratchy but it can work out!,"My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami's in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the 'faux-fur cardi' in the ivory to wear over this top. it's a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you",4,29/03/2018
Disappointed,"I got this shirt in the mail today and was really excited to try it on. other reviewers said that it ran large so i ordered a size down and it fit perfect. i looked in the mirror and noticed the ruffles were misaligned and obviously so. i want to exchange it in the store but seeing that the size is not longer available online, i'm not really sure i'll find another one in my size.",4,24/02/2018
Beautiful and versatile top!,"I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.",5,30/07/2018
Great for work or fun,"I found this to fit tts. i sometimes wear petite, but found the petite sizing to be a little off. i have a pretty short torso, but found the petite to be too short. i opted for the regular sizing and got a 6; it fits great. this top is great for work (styled with a cardigan or blazer) or for play. i can see it dressing up or down very easily.",4,21/11/2018
Perfect shirt for work or night out.,"I ordered the mustard yellow in 10 and found the shirt to fit true to size. it works great with a skirt and with jeans but i did need to wear it with high rise jeans otherwise it came right to the top of my normal jeans and i didn't want to risk showing any skin at work. 

the color is amazing and looks good with just about any color bottom so there is a lot of room to have fun with the top. 

being larger on top the ruffles did not bother me at all, but rather act like an accessory - i find",4,30/06/2018
Undecided,Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.,4,19/09/2018
Perfect top for work,"I got this top in navy and i love it. it's loose and flowy and comfortable, yet dressy enough to wear for work (or dress down with jeans). i'm 5'4"", 125lbs and the 6 was a bit large on me. i could've sized down a little but i actually liked the loose fit, and the length was long enough to tuck in if i wanted to. definitely recommend.",4,08/10/2018
"Overall, i like it, but some sizing issues...","I purchased the navy in this top and i really like the design and the style for the price (i believe the navy is on sale). my issue is that i do have to wear either a camisole or a little bralette or bandeau or something under it because it is too low cut in the front on me and the arm holes are ridiculously large. i might have been better off sizing down, but i bought it online, so i just decided to live with it. pretty top, though i do think it runs large.",4,30/07/2018
Cute!,"This top is really cute and i think will be a great transition piece. i'm glad i tried it on in the store as it runs very small. i typically wear a 00 or 0 and bought this in a 2. they didn't have it in stock,so i ordered it and hope it fits.",4,05/05/2018
Not perfect but cute shirt!!,"I bought this in both the taupe and ivory. the beading on the neck line, the tie at the neck and the pleats make this a fun shirt. i bought a size 2 which is normally what i wear at retailer, so i would say it is true to size. i really like the length of the top. it hits mid-hip on me. it is a tad shorter on the sides than i would like but it is still long enough to cover my waistline. i also think the arms are too long so there is kind of a balloon look at my wrists because of it. i bought it to",4,25/08/2018
"Great color, not so great tailoring","I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",2,11/09/2018
Casual top,"A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!
it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through",4,26/03/2018
Maybe,"After the reviews about sizing, i ordered the size 16 (am normally size large). interestingly, the tag on the blouse says it's a 14. with all that said, the blouse is cute enough and sizing up gave me enough length (in spite of the higher sides) that i'm considering keeping it. although it's a bit big, it flows nicely and isn't oversized in that wide, crazy way. the sleeves are a bit too big but they're cuffed with a button and can be rolled. the fabric is somewhat crinkled in texture. i got the",3,11/07/2018
"Elegant, timeless and versatile","Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.",5,16/03/2018
"Excellent cut and idea,poor fabric c","I love the cut and aesthetic of this shirt, but the fabric unfortunately shows even the slightest hint of sweat, which makes it difficult to wear without being self conscious",3,24/11/2018
Cute shirt but really strange design,"This is a nice shirt, but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time, the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute",2,24/10/2018
Love it,"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.",5,14/09/2018
Great shirt,"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",5,29/10/2018
Great purchase,"Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.",5,11/08/2018
Would love the cut but,"This was going to be my go to top. i loved the look of the billowy shirt, especially in light blue. when it arrived, i knew it wouldn't work for my body. i'm athletic build with muscular upper arms and a d cup. i tried it on anyway. i really wish it fit. it was snug in the upper arms and pulled a bit in the front. i knew if i ordered a size up the arms would still be tight. it's just the cut of the shirt. this top is best for someone that isn't busty and has slender upper arms.",3,13/07/2018
Great top to transition to fall!,"I got tons of compliments when i wore this top out a couple weeks ago. it is a little bit shorter than i thought, and a little bit loose (not ""baggy"" but just kind of hangs). if you have a larger chest, this may not be super-flattering. the color is really pretty and looked great with dark skinnies. i bought my normal size (after trying on a size down, which was just too short...and i'm 5'2)",4,28/10/2018
Nice shirt,I loved the color and the style of the sleeves.  it was a bit too short on me and i thought it made me look boxy so i didn't end up keeping it,4,25/02/2018
Great fall top,Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,5,05/11/2018
Great top for everyday wear!,This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!,5,30/03/2018
Subtle beauty,"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",5,16/11/2018
Great staple,"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.",5,23/04/2018
Flattering,"This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me, but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.
if they had additional colors, i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.",5,21/11/2018
Classic,"I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts, half tucked, and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering, it is a tiny bit sheer, but i was wearing a magenta bra, so perhaps i am biased. overall, i think this is a good basic addition, to a summer wardrobe, can be worn with a nice skirt, or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs, can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs, with 30dd chest.",4,06/05/2018
Wanted to like this more,"I really wanted to like this top, but couldn't seem to find the right fit. i tried it on in 3 different sizes and none of them were right - they were either too wide in the hips, or a little narrow in the shoulder. it is cute overall though - and a good way to do a short top, without feeling like you're in a ""crop top""",3,08/09/2018
Great fun top,"Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.",5,01/09/2018
Cool top,"Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.",5,14/05/2018
"Simple, flattering, very summer","This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it's very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.",5,06/12/2018
The fit is the thing for this top!,"I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.",5,06/07/2018

I so want to love this shirt...,"...the print is so sharking, and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure, and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve, but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.",3,18/07/2018
Very pretty,"I really like this blouse. you could wear it tucked, but the pleats would disappear. my only complaint is that it's a bit too full round the waist. it would be a good choice for thanksgiving dinner!",4,05/04/2018
Very pretty,"As others mentioned, love the little buttons, and the cut is flattering. i ordered the ""denim' one (multicolor). i didn't end up keeping it but will order again if goes to sale. likes: colors are fun, material is soft, buttons are beautiful, cut is decently flattering. what i didn't love is it looks wrinkled.

i ordered the xxs and xsp - only tried on xxs as i didn't think i would keep it anyway, but thinking of it, is should have still tried the xsp. arms were almost snug on me (i lift weight",4,08/03/2018
Pretty blouse,I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.,5,27/04/2018
Love it,"I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very ""busty"". i tried it on at the store, and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple, which i prefer. 

the buttons are beautiful, but i couldn't see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them, since they don't slide out of the buttonholes easily. but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe",5,25/02/2018
Pretty detail,"I first ordered this in the patterned denim. the online photo looks washed out in comparison. the blouse has very pretty detail all along the body and cute brass buttons. the pattern unfortunately looks more vivid in person and as result, i did not like. i brought it to the store and tried on white but it was very sheer (all though the pleating in front helps). i ended up exchanging it with plum which is also beautiful - not as much sheen as shown on the photo, but still beautiful.",4,19/05/2018
Beautiful blouse..try on before purchasing,"I bought this blouse in plum. it is very beautiful, and is a gorgeous color for fall. since i bought this in-person i decided to try it on. i am normally an x-small in retailer blouses. i tried on the x-small, and although it did fit, there isn't much room. this could be a problem for women who are bustier and fuller in the chest and arm area.",4,31/10/2018
Sweetest print,"I ordered size large in the denim color and tops like this are the reason i shop at retailer. this is such a sweet little floral, vertical, slimming, goes with anything print. the buttons down the front close with loops. it's easy to unbutton a few and pull this over your head. i'm a busty 34g and there's no gapping or pulling. the shirt arrived with the sleeves rolled and i had a heck of a time getting those tiny buttons into the cuff but once in, the cuff is wide enough to just slip your arm thr",4,15/11/2018
Love this style,This shirt has a great fit and a nice change from the swing style. short in front and longer in back looks great with the higher waisted pants and traditional skinny. nice details on buttons and trim,4,18/05/2018
Works for casual and business casual,"This is a lovely blouse. i think is a bit roomy, but even so, i like the look. i have to dress business casual for work and this blouse fits the bill as it's not too casual.",4,25/03/2018
I love it!!,"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!",5,14/10/2018
Great design and color,"The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7"" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.",5,09/09/2018
"Great quality, unique design",Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.,5,06/02/2018
Fun piece,"I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris, because i purchased this shirt in carmel, ca and it is actually maeve, which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well. this piece did not disappoint. this is a fun and versatile black top, but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it. i don't find the fabric to be ""rough"" at all, but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece. i am a 34d and did not find my c",5,27/03/2018
"Nice, but not very forgiving","I should preface this by saying that i'm in between sizes. i chose the smaller size and found that this top is not super forgiving. i'm keeping it bc it is good quality and i like the style, but i wouldn't be comfortable wearing it right now! maybe after i lose a few pounds!",4,04/03/2018
Maeve tunic,"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.
the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst",5,09/11/2018
Perfect for fall,"I saw this today and decided to try it on, it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e, and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable, no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees, i'm ready to wear this.",5,12/09/2018
Cute throw on tunic,I loved this tunic. dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties. i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans.,5,05/05/2018
Elegance and comfort,"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.",5,06/11/2018
Front slit,"I somehow missed that there was a slit in the front of this tunic below the buttons. it looks fine on, i'm just wondering if i can still pull it off with only leggings underneath (why i got it). otherwise, just as pictured. i'm 5'7"" 125 lbs and got an xs.",4,19/07/2018
Very blousy but still cute,"I love the length of this - no danger of explosing my muffin-top! the fabric is super cute - good weight, pretty color. i got a medium which is a bit blousy - i think i could have gone with a small.",4,07/06/2018
Cute shirt,"I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.",5,12/05/2018
Great top,Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.,5,02/07/2018
Just ok,"I love good, flowy blouses and like the over sized look, but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it, but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on, because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.",2,21/07/2018
Not for me,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.,3,25/08/2018
Must try on to appreciate.,"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3"".  neckline is fem",5,13/04/2018
"Great fall top, may need to size down","I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6"" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me.",5,06/05/2018
Love it,I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!,5,11/02/2018
Another see through ivory blouse,"I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual, white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!",3,25/01/2018
Great top,"I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer, so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top, especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4'', 120 pounds, and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.",4,30/06/2018
The reviews tell the truth,All the reviews have said the truth. this shirt is absolutely adorable in terms of the top. but you will definitely need this tailored at the waist. give it a little more taper at the seams to suit a woman's curves. it seems almost funny they didn't do it to start with given the really feminine details on this shirt with the lace and the sleeves...,4,30/03/2018
Adorable,Cute top. fits short but roomy. will get a lot of use in my wardrobe.,5,28/05/2018
Versatile !,"Love this shirt...got it in the ""blue"" but i will say the print is a very dark navy, almost black. i'm 130 lbs, 34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!",5,15/11/2018
Quirky staple,"Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing i've ever seen!! i literally bought it as soon as a saw it. i got a size 2. i'm usually a 0 or 00 in most blouses and shirts, but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up. it's definitely not oversized even though i sized up. the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front - really flattering in my opinion. the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf!",5,03/09/2018
Short and wide,First off the prints are gorgeous - i ordered three. i wanted to love them but unfortunately i found them short and wide. so back they go..,3,14/09/2018
Too short :(,"I didn't have any problems with the fit, i love the puffin pattern, the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length, or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it, so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but, yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short, please.",3,20/08/2018
Adorable,"I am partial to maeve tops, i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering, i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a 4 (i go between 2 and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f",5,12/04/2018
Weird maeve sizing/fit,"As another reviewer mentioned, maeve really needs to get their sizing under control and more consistent. i ordered a 4, and while it fits, i think a 6 would be more comfortable in the arms and shoulders (and i'm a thin build). the length on this was also a little weird to me...a little swingy/flared, but also short, making me feel like i'd always be playing with it while wearing. the orange print is absolutely adorable, i just wish the cut were more similar to past buttondowns that maeve has don",3,28/02/2018
Excellent purchase,Bought with the 25% off retailer was running -- usually a little skeptical of maeve regarding size but the material of these shirts is excellent. bought the ski print and the red penguin print. perfect for low-key and where i work!,5,13/09/2018
Great prints,"I am submitting this review because there were size issues mentioned in some reviews. i generally wear a size 4 but often size up to a 6 because i'm a d cup. i purchased an 8 in this because of reviews saying it was small. trying it on , the 8 is fine but it does tent out a lot at the bottom. i think i may have been fine with the 6 because of that; it seems a little big from the back view.",4,21/04/2018
Beautiful top,"I usually wear a 4 in maeve, and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7"", 34c, size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well, though, if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist, the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue, but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo",4,16/10/2018
"Love it, typical nice comfy shirt","I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.

my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.

My winter wonderland,"I seldom buy prints and almost never buy a traditional button front blouse but this shirt is my favorite purchase of the season. i chose the skier print as it was whimsical and subtle. rather than wear it buttoned and tucked i use it as a jacket over solid tees. i bought it a size larger for this reason. i like the layered look and the fabric is flowy and drapes nicely. i have been so pleased with every piece of ""maeve"" clothing i have purchased. once again thinking slightly outside my comfort-z",5,30/08/2018
"Size 16 cut inconsistently, too small","This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",1,06/07/2018
Adorable cat pattern but strange fit,"Love the cute cat pattern and quality of the blouse. unfortunately the front was too short and the back didn't fall properly. also, i found the arms to be tight. i'm usually an xs and a size 2 in maeve blouses. i would've ordered the the 4 but it's sold out. definitely size up if possible.",4,25/06/2018

Great gift,"My kids gave me this blouse for christmas in my usual size 6. it was so tight through the chest, shoulders and arms. i ended up having to exchange it for at size 10! there was barely any difference in the size 8. unfortunately, i now need to have the sleeves shortened, but as this blouse is so cute, it's worth the effort.",4,05/02/2018
Cat lovers dream blouse,"I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover, the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself, the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.",5,19/05/2018

Conversationalist buttondown,"The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type, it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.",3,13/07/2018
"Adorable, fun blouse","I am writing this because my experience with this blouse differs from that of the other reviewers. compared to all my other maeve blouses, this top fits true to size/slightly larger than usual. it's wider/boxier than it appears online, and the arms are totally normal (in fact quite roomy) on me. all the other reviewers thus far have complained of very tight arms/bust and had to size up. i am having the opposite dilemma... given the extra width due to the cut of the blouse, and the fact that the",5,13/03/2018
"Cute top, but uneven fit.","I tried the black cat pattern in the store and it was cute, but the sleeves tend to run quite slim while the bodice is loose. so be aware you may want to size up if you ever have issues with tight sleeves.",4,23/01/2018
Perfect every day top for work or play,"I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and i'm very pleased. they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms, the stripes remain a bit looser throughout. no complaints here! i like the variation. i ordered a size small as i'm normally a size small (36c, 135 lbs, 5'2"").",5,28/10/2018
Fun blouses with cute patterns,I did not find this blouse to be tight in the arms or chest. (i'm a 34a though so maybe that is why?) i also don't have a problem with it being too short in front. i took my usual size 0. i like the feel of the fabric and the prints are great. the only thing i slightly dislike is the flowy bottom of the shirt. i wish it was more fitted and that is why i took one star off. i got the cat print. the cat faces are white and on random faces there are pink ears or a pink nose.or a winking eye - just a,4,21/05/2018
No problems w fit.,"So, i'm really surprised that reviewers said the fit was too small and too tight in the arms. i'm 5'7"" and 183lbs and my husband (god bless his soul) bought me an 8 for my birthday. i tried it on just to see and was pretty impressed i could button it across my chest and get it over my arms as those are common problem areas for me. regardless i need to exchange the shirt for a larger size because even though i got it on its not how is supposed to look. the shirt is loose around the midsection whi",5,01/04/2018
Best of maeve,"I love this brand! they produced a number of incredibly cute blouses in 2006-2010 and i've missed their quirky designs. this shirt does not run small. i am usually a 6 and have a little extra room in the chest area, even though i'm a 34dd. the arms are the perfect length as well which is nice as i have long arms. the only reason i did not give it five stars is that i wish it was a bit more fitted through the stomach area. its very billowy. i may take it to the tailor... so cute though! on a side",4,30/10/2018
Memories,"When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch",5,07/05/2018

Its alright,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.,2,28/01/2018
Baggy,I read the other reviews that said the shirt ran small but i found that it fit fine and i chose my regular size in maeve. the only issue is that it's baggy around the middle which is a little off and i found that it was a little too short. i gave it four stars because of the print. i chose the cat print and it's just so adorable. i might try to have the shirt taken in at the waist and then it would be perfect.,4,27/09/2018
Lots of room!,"I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok, maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight, but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!",3,01/07/2018
Cute shirt!,I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to,5,07/07/2018
Weird fit,"I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers, i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though, so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart",3,22/05/2018
"Cute, quirky prints and comfortable!","I am somewhat of a perennial sale-only retailer purchaser (often even when a promo code, i don't buy full price! lol!). when i saw this top i decided it was worth it. i got the penguin print - my 2-year-old squealed when she saw me pull it out of the box! thanks, retailer, for your woodland-inspired prints that enamor my little one.

Thumbs up for the downhill skier blouse,"I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant, cute also ;-)
rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest. the sloping longer hemline toward the",5,19/11/2018
"Very baggy, but adorable fabric pattern","The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.",2,08/02/2018
Best thing i've bought myself in a long time!,"I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime, but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord",5,11/06/2018
Ski jumpers,"I love the design on this top- so playful! i was super confused on what size to buy since all the reviews said different things, so i bought a size 0 and size 2. i'm usually a size 0 or xs is most clothes, and after trying both on, i kept the size 0. it's ever so slightly snug in the chest area, but the sleeves and shoulder areas fit perfectly. the size 2 was a little too wide and drapey and the sleeves were a little long.",4,02/12/2018

Not cut like a traditional button down,"I ordered the red color way, and the bird print is very cute. that said, it is cut a-line and not like a regular button down. through i found it tts and good quality, it was shorter than i would have liked. this exaggerated the a-line shape. i didn't completely dislike it, but i didn't love it either.",3,02/05/2018
Conversationalist button-down with cats,"I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.

very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.",5,14/07/2018
Nice shirt,"I really like this shirt. the design and colors are very good. i ordered the black one with cats, it was cool. however, in general i don't like high-low tops because they don't look flattering and you can see that it is asymmetrical from the front, makes it awkward. the shirt's design doesn't make the high-low aspect stand out much which is great. but it is a tad shorter than i would like in the front. it is also loose fitting. it is perfect for a slimmer frame, but on my curvy figure it just wa",4,07/09/2018
Just didn't work for me,"This shirt looks nice on the model, but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me.",3,25/01/2018
So flattering,"I love this top, on me, it looks so flattering, the tie detail is really nice, and i love the white subtle details at the bottom and collar. i actually haven't seen the sleeves unrolled on me, i roll them up. the tie part is a little wrinkled from shipment, but who cares. i ordered the regular 0 as the petite have been sold out a longtime ago, i actually got this shirt a while back and thought i had already written a review... i am wearing it with boyfriend jeans right now (for casual friday and",5,08/09/2018
Strange,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",2,23/08/2018

Perfectly unique white top,"I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.",5,21/03/2018
So cute....but,"I really like this shirt but it's a bit maternity. i don't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here. i'm 5' 7"" about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret. since i'm done having kids, it has to go back. 
it's also somewhat see through and had i kept it, i would have worn a tank top underneath.

Romantic flowy beauty,"This blouse is a beauty! i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back. i love the long length and the side slits. the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely. the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at. it makes me feel beautiful just having it on. be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank, but i don't mind as it is both pretty and comfortable. i sized up, which fits how i like. i never tried it on in my normal size",5,26/05/2018

Oh so sweet when it's the right fit,"I saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses, so off i went to my local retailer. this blouse turned out to be delightful! my thoughts: i would say it fits true to size, as a 0 fits me perfectly in the shoulders. it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit, so it's not possible to wear this as a dress (it is very sheer too). i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust, so my incredibly flat chest works in this. if you have even",5,10/08/2018

Gorgeous,I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.,5,03/09/2018
Like but not love,"I tried on the pink in xs in store. it was so big on me. i wanted to love it, the stylist did, but i felt meh... so did another costumer, didn&#39;t like it on me. the colors are really nice (and the blue seems really nice too), but the cut was a little wide. fabric is very soft. for reference, i am 115 lbs, 0dd, 26.5 in waist.",3,15/11/2018
Lovely colors but huge and not as pictured,"I loved the colors (especially the pink) and thought this would be really pretty. however, when i received it, its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it. i also found it huge. normally, i wear an xxsp or a 00p (for reference i am 5'2, 30e and 24 in waist. i tried both the xxsp (fit better but was too short) and the xxs (too large). i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted, but its definitely not.",2,08/02/2018
Even more vibrant in person!,"The colors on this blouse are beautiful and even more vibrant in person. i love that the blouse is lightweight, perfect to wear to any holiday gathering!",5,08/04/2018
"This blouse is simply the best, i love it!","Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.",5,25/04/2018
Amazing!,"Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it doesn't look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.",5,07/04/2018
A wardrobe must have,"This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest.",5,15/04/2018
Fun top,"Really like this top. fun flair, nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4""). will send petite back.",5,06/04/2018
Stand alone blouse,"This blouse, with a scalloped hem, is a good blouse to wear by itself. it goes well with higher waisted bottoms. it is very boxy. i like that but did buy a petite instead of s regular to compensate (i swing both ways on oetite/regular sizing). i'm so-so about the patch pockets, the material is fairly heavy, but they do add to the look of the top. it's well made and nicely finished.",4,25/04/2018
This garment has lovely features,"I really liked the beautiful fabric, design, and length of the piece.",4,05/02/2018
Good quality but ok fit,"High quality top, but material is not very soft-- may soften in the wash. fit is okay.",4,19/06/2018
"Good for weekends, not for work","This top's subtle golden shimmer from the metallic thread used in the detailing is really nice. flattering, a bit special, all in all nice. but the white is see through, and the green somehow reads much more casual, at least to me. so a good top for times when your top being sheer isn't such a big deal but probably not for the office.",4,28/04/2018
Perfect buttondown,"I almost bought this tank online, but decided to wait. once i saw it in the store, i knew i had to have it. i bought it in the ivory color, which is perfect. the gold details are subtle, and so pretty. i don't find it too sheer, as some of the other reviews have stated. the cut is so flattering, and it is easy to wear to work when paired with a cardigan.",5,16/09/2018
Classic and comfortable,This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.,5,22/01/2018
Very chic,"Bought this in white and the golden embroidery makes this piece very elegant looking. it is a bit sheer, but with a lace bra definitely very nice. that is the only con, i wish it would be not sheer at all. but it is too beautiful to send it back for that reason.",4,20/06/2018
"Such a great, classic top with a big issue","I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",2,25/03/2018
Very cute/feminine,"I got the top in green, it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.",5,07/05/2018
"Sweet design, but too short to wear around","I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest, it was shorter than i usually like my tops, so i will be returning it.",3,16/04/2018
Perfect versatile top,This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!,5,13/08/2018
Too sheer for me,"I really liked this top. i wish it was not so sheer. even with a nude bra, its just too much. it's a very loose fit throughout the body, but the shoulders, arms, and neckline remain true to size so it looks nicely tailored on the top. i just can't do something this sheer. i feel too exposed. i wish they had it offered in other colors.",4,07/02/2018
Because you can't have enough cream tops,"I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out, but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7"" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small, so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection,",5,14/07/2018
Pleasantly surprised by this black gem,"You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy, going out look. in the picture it looks more casual, but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt, wearing it to work, or whatever. i tried it on and i thought ""wow, i look thin."" it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry, it's not a crop top, but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips, probably mid-rise), but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba",5,23/02/2018
So disappointed!,"I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.",1,27/07/2018
Beautiful details but cut small,"I ordered this in an xs, which is my normal size in retailer tops. the stitching and detail on the straps is beautiful, but they were also somewhat tight across my bust and across my back. it puckered in a strange way that wasn't flattering. back it goes, unfortunately.",3,25/10/2018
"Felt cheap, not like retailer","This top seemed so unique online, but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full, shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice,quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..",2,27/08/2018
"Beautiful top, but ill filtting","This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however, the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't, so it's going back.",2,08/06/2018
Pink,"I actually rather like this top, i ordered a size smaller than usual, based on how flowy it looks in the picture, and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich, and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it, and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot, but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material, so of course, it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also, there was no petite in the pink, so can't comment on",5,06/02/2018
Beautiful beautiful top!,"I found this top to be quite flattering.........the slight give in the outer straps is necessary to allow for arm movement without issue.
i did not find it to diminish the aesthetic value.
i purchased it in white and loved it so much that i ordered the black also....not much of a pink person or i would have gotten that one too!
classic with a bit of a casual edge.
a must get!",5,06/11/2018
Lovely idea that does not work,"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",2,05/11/2018
Beautiful & tricky,"I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny, and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma",3,21/10/2018
Beautiful!,"Love this top! with swing/loose tops, i always size down. i'm 5'1"", 115, 34b, and took a 0. it fit very well, i tried a 2 on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat. so size down if you can! i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it, works well!",5,06/08/2018
If you have a boyish figure this top is for you,"I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction, lace details, 3/4 sleeves.",3,13/04/2018
Small through shoulders,"I am 5 8"", 130 and i usually wear a 4 in tops like this from retailer but the fit of this one was not good for me. though the styling and details of the top are lovely, it was small through the shoulders and very large everywhere else. looked too much like maternity. i love the shape of this kind of top but to be flattering it actually needs to be fitted through the bust and upper body and then flare in the right places and this was pretty boxy all around. too bad - so cute!",3,19/06/2018
Holding horses beauty,This top is a lovely combination of rugged and refined and will be versatile wear for a party pared with nice pants and flats to casual with jeans and boots. it appears well made though i had to size up for my broad shoulders but other hh tops fit the same way.,4,24/05/2018
Lovely blouse with great detail,Looks wonderful with a pair of dark skinny jeans and cowgirl boots.,4,26/03/2018
Lace chambray top,"This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.",5,26/08/2018
Not bad,"I ordered this shirt, aware of what the other reviewers said about it being tight in the chest. it's true- it's a bit restrictive if you need full-range of motion for your shoulder blades, but if you're not planning on doing any heavy-lifting or sporting events in this top, it's just fine (disclaimer- i am small-chested). i will stick by my tts, though, because it was the right fit, despite being restrictive. i was worried the top was going to be a 'hard' jean, but it wasn't. it was nice and sof",4,14/09/2018
Runs small,"This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top, felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest .",4,15/11/2018
"Great blouse, runs small","I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said, this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders, so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted, but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the",5,01/12/2018
Nice top but strange fit,"This top is very nice. good quality, good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top, especially around my shoulders, while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured, perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.",3,16/10/2018
Crazy big,"Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00, and, oddly enough, there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy, or is the 00 size just a sham?",3,14/02/2018
Very flattering!,"This shirt is very attractive! i tried on my usual size 2 and it fits like a glove. i wish they had more colors than ivory, but i couldn't pass up the unique fit and design of this shirt.",5,29/11/2018
Really cute!,"When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh",5,08/06/2018
Prettier in pic!,"I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep, i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.",2,27/02/2018
Go to top,"When i'm looking for something comfortable to wear that looks effortless and cool, this is the top i pick! i ended up buying it in navy too. it's really soft, ur washes well, and it's great quality! a must have.",5,22/09/2018
Lovely,"This shirt fits true to size, and is lovely. i love the 'v' in the back, and i believe this would look wonderful on all body types. i ordered my usual size and was very pleased.",4,20/03/2018
Size up for bigger bust,"I normally wear a 4 or 6 at retailer and bought this in a 6. the size 6 is even a tad small in the bust area but not small enough to size to an 8. i am 32d for reference. for ladies larger than a c cup, i would recommend sizing to your larger size. definitely try on at the store if you can.",4,27/08/2018
In love!! best buy of the year,"So i almost returned this top without trying it on because i've been binging on tops with thin blue lines but so glad i didn't!! i'm busty like ddd36 and i weigh 170, but i got the 8 and it fits like a glove! perfection!! plus i got it on sale!! so fab!",5,20/11/2018
"Awwww, so cute!","I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.",5,27/11/2018
So cute on!,"I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt, but decided to try it on. i loved it on!
it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person, and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full, but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person, but my guess is it may surprise you!",5,30/03/2018
Cute top,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.,3,20/09/2018
"Again, my bad for not looking at description...","I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.
this top is just reall",2,25/04/2018
"Light, airy & pretty","I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but, a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy, but it does fit. so, if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose, imho you can size down.

the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th",5,17/04/2018
Beautiful transition piece,"Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.",5,03/08/2018
Love it,"I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.",5,11/10/2018
Such a cute top!,"I ordered this in the darker color. i was excited to try it on when it arrived the fabric was really nice, good quality and the design is so cute. sadly it did not work for me. there is a lot of volume especially in the back which does not work for my curvy shape. i can see this top working well on a straighter figure but the volume and length really just did not flatter my hips and thighs. i will be sending this back.",4,04/08/2018
Too boxy,I had high hopes for this top. i love the plaid and design but found it too boxy and short. the front was cut too low as well.,4,30/10/2018
So cute!,"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature",5,29/04/2018
See-through,"I am torn about this top. on the one hand, it is beautiful in all aspects:
flattering cut
beautiful detail at neck, victorian neckline
ivory color, flattering on most skin tones, including my very pale skin
speck of gold in fabric, it is lines with gold thread

bummers: it is see-through, as in you can see through the neck part. the picture online shows a more covered look, i think the model ash a shirt underneath. on me, you really see the skin through. so i will have to try with a nude b",4,06/05/2018
Soft beautiful top,This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,5,30/01/2018
Really pretty!,I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.,3,17/05/2018
Rather cheap looking,Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it. if you look really close in the photo you can see it.,2,21/04/2018
I loved this blouse - except for the sizing,"I loved this blouse, but had to return. i am 5'2"", 127 lbs. 36d. i found that the blouse was tight in the bust and very wide in the shoulders. the sleeves are puffy, which is fine, but the wideness is from edge of the bib to where the sleeve is attached and therefore the top did not lay flat. if you have wide shoulders and a small bust - this blouse will be perfect for you. i liked the material, it was thin but perfect for a summer nights.",3,23/08/2018
"Beautiful design, way too large","I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big.",2,13/04/2018
Stunning,This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.,5,03/03/2018
Buttondown,"On the hanger i thought this had a chance, but oh geez... puffy sleeves, itchy, metallic thread, lace... what a mess. and thin. and uncomfortable. no, no, no.",2,21/11/2018
Beautiful!,Beautiful shirt! i recently purchased this on sale and it has been marked down even further so definitely buy it! it is very pretty with the gold interwoven in the material. the peplum is also not overwhelming. it looks great with a pair of jeans and heels. my husband immediately commented on this shirt and he does not notice anything?,4,12/02/2018
Tent,"This item is huge. i'm normally a medium, sized down to a small, still massive. couldn't go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest. but the sleeves are very wide, as is the waist. way too much fabric. i had high hopes for this one but it just doesn't work. for reference i love billowy and flowy tops, but this was a tent.",2,26/06/2018
It's growing on me...,"Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully, irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6, an a cup, 150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.",5,29/10/2018
Very bulky at the bottom,I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer,2,20/05/2018
Way too big,"I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.",1,21/07/2018
Adorable!,"Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!",5,27/10/2018
Cute!,"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand, so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7"", 128#, 34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price.",4,18/10/2018
Modern baby doll style,"Purchased the cream color in my local store. it looks great with jeans or leggings. i've worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too. it is very comfortable, runs big, but it's meant to not be fitted. the addition of pockets, (that don't stick out), makes me love it even more! i will be wearing this from fall to spring. great design, retailer!!!",5,22/02/2018
Tight sleeves,Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.,1,15/05/2018
Adorable but runs large...,"I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu",5,06/07/2018
Runs large,"This top looks adorable in the product photos, so i had high hopes. i think i might be too short to pull it off, but like another reviewer said, i found it to be like a tent on me, billowing out in all directions. it was just overall too big on me--i even considered whether i could wear it as a dress, but the sleeves were also too billowy on me. i am 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried the xs.",3,27/06/2018
Soft and swinging,The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.,4,11/07/2018
Perfect fall tunic!,"This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!",5,14/07/2018
"Adorable, comfortable tunic","I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.",5,05/03/2018
"Soft, feminine and fun pockets!","I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.",5,15/03/2018
"Excellent, but flowy","I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!",5,30/08/2018
Easy to wear,"Yes, this runs big but i sized down from med to small and it works. i like the gray/white pattern. received compliments upon first wearing and know i'll wear it often. i knocked off a star because of the rayon fabric which wrinkles so easily. this top always looks rumpled in the back from sitting. still i'm glad to have it in my fall wardrobe.",4,06/08/2018
Perfect maternity top!,"Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.",2,19/05/2018
So pretty,"I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big, so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice, is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too, perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar",5,28/06/2018
Beautiful but thin,"Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only once.

got a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though it's a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits.",2,25/07/2018
Perfect tunic,"My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much. perfect tunic length, swingy, detailed...but as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it. i just got it and im in love! the orange print is so lovely. the perfect fall color and the print is timeless. the fabric is light and easy. the fit is definitely bigger, but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl. i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room, but i needed the xl for room i",5,01/08/2018
Fits weird,"I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird, slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning",2,06/07/2018
Great for summer,"I tried this tunic at a store and loved it. i had to buy a much bigger size because the sleeves are so narrow.
the 12 fit ok but the sleeves are so tight it hurt. i have normal arms and i am so glad i was at a store to try a bigger size.",4,26/07/2018
Comfy & cute,I think i'll get a lot of wear out of this. you will be able to size down & it will still hide a host of sins. it's very comfortable and stylish.,4,12/06/2018
Luscious luster,"I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.",5,19/07/2018
New favorite,"Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.",5,19/08/2018
Lovely tunic,"I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well",5,20/09/2018
Pregnant ladies,"This definitely works for you - think fabric, great quality, and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant, cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.",4,28/11/2018
Love this tunic!!!,"This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go",5,16/04/2018
Huge and then some!,"I bought the orange in xxs petite, and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.

i like a swing style, but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer, and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.",3,18/09/2018
Boho perfect,"If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!",5,06/12/2018
New favorite,I love this tunic.  it is so comfortable and looks great with leggings and boots.  perfect fall look.,5,26/05/2018
Cute top,"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -",5,27/06/2018
"I joined the "" holding horses"" fan club","I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this",5,17/03/2018
Too small,"This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.",1,04/02/2018
Little house on the prairie top,Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.,2,28/03/2018
Mock neck rocks,"I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look",5,03/10/2018
Something a little different,"This top is a departure from my usual style, but i had to give it a try because it looked so comfy yet structured. i wish the material was less sheer as i have to wear a cami underneath when i wear it to work. i'm 5'3 / 135lb and the 6 fits just fine.",4,21/02/2018
Great weekender!,"This is about the cutest thing since...well i don't know but it's pretty cute. yes, i agree with the other reviewer who said it looked better in hand than on the web! has cute, soft ruffle just above hip and the stripes are soft pastels. the buttons at the nape of the neck are sweet. there's the word-sweet-that's the perfect descriptive for this quirky, laid back, feminine piece. tts-nothing weird or uncomfortable about the fit but it does seem a bit shorter than the picture shows. i am 140 lbs",5,13/08/2018
Very cute fall top,"This top is a keeper. subtle plaid, flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!",5,07/09/2018
Cute top!,"This top looks better on than on the hanger. i've been looking for a feminine plaid top and this is the one! it's a flirty and innocent look in one. i would say size up. it runs a little tight around the upper arm, shoulders area when stretching arms out. i normally wear a size 2-4 depending on the top and the 6 felt better.",4,05/05/2018
Cute!,"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless.",5,25/11/2018
Beautiful!,"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!",5,08/06/2018
Very flattering,This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!,5,12/10/2018
Love this top,This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.,5,14/10/2018
Pretty but fussy,"Drawn to the colors, i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 or l in fitted tops
this top is a cropped, even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement), but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full, so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up, too. the quality is an issue, with exposed threads and irregular seams.",3,11/09/2018
Valo burnout top,"Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length, but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well, everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item, but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!",3,08/05/2018
Style with a kick,This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers. very flattering fit!,5,19/09/2018
Cute pattern but design wasn't flattering,"I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn't find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn't look as good on me.",2,06/12/2018
"Cute patterns, but gaps at buttons","I had the same problem i usually have with button-front shirts when i tried this on: gapping at the buttons over the bust. i tried on the striped motif in my usual size. it was also a little snug in the underarms, but fit very nicely everywhere else. i just can't justify sizing up to fit my bust when it means i'll have to have the shirt tailored to fit everywhere else.

the stripe pattern and navy pattern (the one with the birds) are true to the online pictures. the black one was disappointing i",4,09/04/2018
Why we love maeve,"Another great whimsical print by maeve! as of late, this brand has really fallen all over the board for me, but this top had the right fabric, fit, and pattern to hold onto the parrot print. it looks great loose or tucked in. the parrot print has plenty of accent colors to make this match with many things. cute!",4,08/03/2018
No more rainy day blues,"I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.",5,01/08/2018
Perfect,"Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice, recommend hand wash!",5,25/04/2018
As depicted but not for me,"This shirt looks just like it does in the picture, and my favorite detail was the buttons. i was a little disappointed in the stitching of the front tucks, as it looked sloppy at the ends, but you might find that rustic/charming. this is a great top for spring/summer. i ordered an 8p, and it fit well everywhere except the chest, so i'm returning it. my bust is about 37""(32ddd), and it was slightly too tight. if i go up a size it will probably make me look bigger than i am, nevermind the horizont",4,01/06/2018
So much fun!,"I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception. i am a 32b and broad shouldered and my normal size 6 fit like a dream. the white print is opaque so no bra see-through. such a cute, fun print! the fabric has a really soft hand too.",5,17/11/2018
Beautiful colors & fabric,"This top is so pretty and the fabric is really soft...but, it does fit a little bit small in the bust. i am not extremely large busted but the buttons gap open just a little and it's tight across my back. otherwise, i love this top and the colors are really, really nice.",4,20/06/2018
True to size - like it so much i bought 2,I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,5,16/10/2018
Very cute shirt,I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!,5,03/02/2018
Umbrellas to brighten up your rainy day,"Cute top & well constructed. was surprised at the various gatherings i hadn't noticed before ordering, really like the billowy aspect on the bottom. received lots of compliments.",4,02/05/2018
Darling top!,I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,5,29/06/2018
Love the print,"I also found this blouse fits well and runs true to size. a size 2 was perfect, not too tight and not too full. the umbrellas and raindrops are so cute and bright. i will wear with jeans or dressier slim pants. what fun!",5,02/03/2018
"Beautiful, but too big.","Based on reviews, i got the medium pink size: 8 petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap. i'm 5'6"" and 32d. i figured the 8 petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter. it was too big and even though it was petite, still too long. wanted to like it, but at full price, decided to return.",5,17/10/2018
Fun patterns and prints for a rainy day ;-),"I bought the umbrella print in the petite length. i'm pleased with the whimsical print and crisp colors. the fit is just right for me, although the style runs a bit wide at the waist. it's a casual loose fit, more fitted on top at the bust, shoulders and sleeves, and flaring out below the waist. i would wear it untucked over jeans or a narrow skirt. the only thing i'm not crazy about is the rayon fabric, though it is a substantial weight and machine washable.",4,25/07/2018
Not great,"The shape is awkward, too loose, not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.",2,07/10/2018
Great shirt,I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.,5,30/05/2018
Love the stripes!,"I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.",5,07/05/2018
Striped version adorable,"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said, i think this top fits really well, and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small, and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest, and i'm a 34d. (5'4"", 124 lbs, 36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue, however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po",5,04/04/2018
Cute and springy,This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.,5,25/10/2018
Buy in multiple colors!,"I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!",5,13/08/2018
So many compliments!,I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!,5,07/06/2018
Didn't work!,"I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.",1,17/07/2018
Tight across chest,Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!,4,08/06/2018
Amazing. must have top!,I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,5,21/03/2018
Love this top,"Love this top, flattering on my post baby body. its feminine and soft",5,10/03/2018
Wonderful!,"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s",5,05/08/2018
"Easy, breezy comfort that looks great!",Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!,5,05/10/2018
Great top!,"Love this top! kept looking online, but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store, i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1"", but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit, tts. love the colors in the pink top!",5,22/03/2018
Surprisingly comfy for a button down,"I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!",5,11/11/2018
Beautiful piece,"I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others, but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look, because it's pretty drapey. really versatile, lovely tunic.",5,07/03/2018
Fun shirt for work or weekend wear!,This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!,5,03/11/2018
Great shirt,"I ordered this shirt last week, and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual, but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black), and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.",5,06/10/2018
Super cute,Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend,5,28/01/2018
Fun top,"I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.",5,10/02/2018
Awesome shirt,"This shirt is a 10! i've been looking for an off the shoulder top that i can wear a bra with. i almost never spend full price on retailer items but this one is worth every penny. don't hesitate, just buy it!",5,03/08/2018
"Cute top, very forgiving","I purchased this in the 6p and the 8p. both fit similar, but the 6p was just a little more form fitting. the problem i have with this top is that while the top of the shirt and the shoulders are awesome, the rest of the top is pretty boxy. i am a 36c, broad shoulders. i did layer it with a longer necklace which helped deter the boxy look. if the mid section could be a little more form fitting, it would be a perfect top! soft, cool fabric, great for summer.",4,01/06/2018
Not for me,"Adorable top, but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top, also by maeve, but the sizing on that runs small, medium, large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso, and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also, i didn't",3,01/05/2018
Great.... though....,"Ok, so this is adorable. i am 5'3"" and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly. the back was too long and hung funny on my short body. after it was reworked, it is the cutest thing i own. they also made the little belt tighter across my waist. it is super versatile. my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine. so---- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention.",4,12/11/2018
This one falls short,"Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes, the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i",3,08/02/2018
Sleeveless lab coat,"Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish, 118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i",3,25/04/2018
Maternity blouse,"I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.",2,22/01/2018
Beautiful!,Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!,5,19/11/2018
Maeve has done it again,"Maeve has done it again with a fabulous blouse. i bought in the blue motif and the colors are so wonderfully fall. the length is great for skinny jeans and leggings. loved that it covered the rear end as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, 34c and the size small fit well.",5,22/03/2018
Long in the back,"Another really cute iop (i tried on the blue), but if you are short, you definitely ned a petite size. sofy fabric, and pretty pattern, like hte tie nexk. too bad they sold out in my size...",4,03/10/2018
Adorable top!,"I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!",5,18/08/2018
Love the fit!,I adore this blouse. i bought it in the blue at my local store and ordered the white! so cute. be careful- i dried my blue one (i openly did not read the care instructions..haha) and it shrunk a little. still beautiful though!,5,06/05/2018
Great blouse!,"This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this, i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted, the bottom is very fluid).",5,10/09/2018
Cute top,"They were sold out of the medium that i usually wear in tops so i got a petite large hoping that would work. it obviously isn't the ideal fit but it will manage. it's very cute, but the colors aren't as vibrant as they looked in the pictures. for example the red in the floral print looks more like a rust color in person. but i do like it and plan on keeping it. will look cute with dark jeans and brown boots.",4,16/02/2018
Great top,This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.,5,01/07/2018
Pretty in blue,"I ordered this top in xs and blue, its subtle but pretty on, as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance, is not uncomfortable, just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top, want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.",4,26/01/2018
Love this blouse!,I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!,5,09/03/2018
"Gorgeous print, cut small in bust","I loved the print on this top in navy from the picture, and loved it even more in person. it is gorgeous, and the top feels high quality. that said, as usual with maeve clothing it fit me strangely. i am curvy with a small upper body (34 d) but larger bust, and maeve tops are almost always too tight in the bust and too flowy around the middle , which creates a pregnant look on me at least. i feel their fit model must be small busted, so for small busted ladies this top would be lovely. i always",4,05/06/2018
Great top,Love everything about the top. it's very versatile wear by itself or with a cute jacket. it's a great staple to have in your closet.,5,31/01/2018
Cute top!,"I love the print on this. love. and the fit, for a swing blouse, was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true, but this one is so nice! i loved it so much, but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this, but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.",5,26/07/2018
Beautiful color,The color is just beautiful. i've gotten so many compliments!,4,21/05/2018
Cute top,"Overall this top is very cute. it needs to be ironed before you can really judge it's cuteness! the sleeves are short and feature gold toned plastic buttons. for the price of the shirt, i thought the buttons looked cheap.",4,21/09/2018
Beautiful!,"Wow, i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank, i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy. 
would totally buy different colors if it came in others, but i'm no",5,20/05/2018
"Love, but difficult fit","In maeve i run between a size 2-4.  my regular size 4 was too tight in the shoulders, the fabric didn't drop off the shoulders like it does on the model.  it also felt too tight near the back were the button is, almost as if there was not enough fabric.  the sleeves were also too short and tight around the arms.  sized up to a 6 and all those issues were fixed.  since this top is billowy anyway the size up really didn't mess with the shape of the top.  love the gold color, so pretty!",4,13/07/2018
Love this top,"I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.",5,25/04/2018
There is no care instructions sewn into this garme,I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions.,3,23/05/2018
Not great quality,"After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately, the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!",2,22/11/2018
Cute and unique,"I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!

please, retailer, expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly.",5,20/02/2018
Very versatile tunic,"Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo. tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i'm a 34 dd, 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine. i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher, but none were available. still the regular 10 works well. excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans, and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami. seems very ve",5,07/02/2018
Cool summery tunic,"I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.",5,27/07/2018
"Love the colors, not a fan of the side slit","Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great, comfortable fit, but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.",3,09/04/2018
Comfortable,Comfortable with leggings or cropped skinnies. would be better as a solid as opposed to a plaid print. breathable and airy fabric.,4,25/04/2018
Lovely but not quite right,"I definitely think this may have worked had i tried on a petite-sized version for the length. i was not at one of the stores with the petites. i did feel like at 5'2"" the regular size is just too long. i tried a size 4 on with leggings and that didn't look right. the size 4 seemed fine (34b chest, 118 lbs). maybe if i had a different pair of pants on but the slits up the sides of the shirt made it look not quite right with leggings. i kept thinking the shorter size would have helped. i really li",4,07/04/2018
Cute but not for me,"I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length, slits, tie, stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas, it isn't meant to be...",3,19/03/2018
Loved this online,"I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however, the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides, the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.",2,03/12/2018
A winner for sure.,"I love the color combo, and the design make me feel tall and thin. i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day. i like it with my white jeans, and you can wear it a number of ways. i love this brand, i still wear the plaid from last spring. it's a got to have.",5,19/08/2018
Unique long piece,"I love this with white leggings that skim my legs b/c it is a looser top that you can cinch at the waist. one small complaint is that the tie is awkward with the side slits, but for the sale price, i can overlook this.",4,22/02/2018
Like a bolt of fabric,"Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.",1,19/08/2018
I wanted to love!,"I received this yesterday and the fit for me is so strange...to tight in the bust and the arms were to big for me..i am so bummed...the arms do not stay on my shoulders. i have many tops but maeve and they fit me well..this is the first one i have to return. this top is made well and i do recommend, but it should be tried on before purchasing as it is pricey if it does not fit you!",3,08/04/2018
Great fall blouse,"This blouse is very versatile. it can be worn with jeans or dress pants. great fall color. 
it is very sheer and you will need to wear something under it. it's pretty in person with an original print design.",4,14/07/2018
Super cute,"I bought this is the orange/red motif and it is a beautiful print, although in person it is a more rich reddish color than the washed out model image. the entire shirt is sheer, so i will need to wear something under, but that doesn't bother me. i have a small chest (34a) and find that the front of the shirt is noticeably longer than the back, but that wouldn't be an issue if i was a little better endowed. this looks gorgeous with black pants and a blazer. not sure that it is worth full price, b",4,29/07/2018
Fall dots,Great transition into fall for layering. easy breezy dress up or down-is thin so it does need a cami,4,08/05/2018
Flowy and light,"This top us flowy, breathable, and feminine. the fabric is light so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric. it is sheer so a cami underneath is best. with flowers, less structured tops, i size down to a small or 6. some other tops i'd go to medium or 8.",5,03/02/2018
Perfect fall blouse,I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.,5,12/11/2018
Great top,This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!,5,04/02/2018
Beautiful!,"This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer, but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy, so if you're looking for something more fitted, this might not be for you.",5,14/10/2018
So cute!,"I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night, for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!",5,25/06/2018
Cutest blouse,"I ordered this in the tangerine and it is so cute. its very comfortable and flattering. i wore a tank under it, but didn't find it to be as sheer as other reviewers. i paired it with slim pants, brown suede ankle boots and a long necklace and it was one of the cutest outfits i have worn in a long time. i got a lot of compliments! i want this in tons of colors/patterns!",5,03/02/2018
Love it!,I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!,5,25/02/2018
Stylish and ready for layering,"I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it's a color you wouldn't normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i'm looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.
i'm a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit's snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin",5,25/08/2018
Nope,"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms, all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra",3,07/03/2018
Cute blouse,"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",5,25/09/2018
This blouse is a perfect fall print!,I purchased the orange tiger print and absolutely love it! the colors and pattern are rich and vibrant and can easily be dressed up to be worn for work or a night out!,4,20/09/2018
?? the print.,I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.,5,06/03/2018
The definition of a conversation piece,"This is a quirky, whimsical, uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is, a fun, conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts, very comfy, yes boxy, but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties, or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.",5,08/10/2018
"Runs large, too boxy","The material is nice and of good thick, quality. feels a bit stiff due to the lovely embroidery. unfortunately this top runs large and is not fitted at all. as the material is thick and stiff it does not drape well which makes for an unflattering look.",4,24/07/2018
Have gotten multiple compliments,"I don't usually wear this much color, but i'm so glad i purchased this top. it is really cute on and professional enough for work, but with a tank underneath and the buttons undone, its casual too. i have received several compliments both times i have worn the shirt. sleeves are a bit long.",4,04/12/2018
Hangs funny,I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back,3,01/12/2018
Great top,"Love this top! the color is very pretty, great for the holidays. i haven't washed it yet, but it says machine wash which is a plus for me.",5,28/03/2018
Soft and flowy,"This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.",5,27/01/2018
So pretty,"I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on, very comfortable. fit is great.",5,09/07/2018
Easy wear!,Great top! very easy to wear. looks great with jeans or dressier pants.,5,30/08/2018
Scalloped heaven,"What a cute top! i would say true to size. it is a pullover so i went with a 6, for easy dressing. the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely. i would say the top is a lined in cut. not too swingy at all. a great length to be left out or tucked in. i can think of so many uses for this top, i may grab another to keep on hand. will be adorable with skirts or shorts.",5,12/04/2018
Essential feminine white blouse,"I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. i'm not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.",5,13/02/2018
Wanted to love this!,"I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short, and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.",3,15/05/2018
Another great one from maeve,"I am usually a 4 in maeve tops, but i sized up to a 6. i am 5'7"" 127 lbs. it is a crisp white, comfortable, easy to wear tank that requires some ironing or steaming. it doesn't look like much in the photo, but once i saw it in person and tried it on, it was an easy decision to make the purchase. it is feminine and has a pronounced a-line shape to it.",5,27/08/2018
"Not-so-basic, basic white top","I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer, so that i can wear it without a cami underneath. on that count, this top is a winner!
regarding the fit, it is a shorter top, so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted, and i wouldn't be able to tuck it in.
in fact, i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit.
fyi: 36c (34d), broad shoulders/back, short waist - in a fitted shirt i take a 10/12, but i tried this",5,11/05/2018
Great top for summer!,"Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.",5,21/10/2018
Cute top!,This is really cute - with a statement necklace or without. jeans or shorts. love it.,5,11/06/2018
Basic black bonus,"Just a little scallop makes this top special. 
if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up. 
fabric crisp-well made and worth full price",5,17/09/2018
Beautiful blouse!!!,"This is a beautiful blouse and well made!!! i read the previous reviews and i'm usually between sizes 8 and 10, so i sized-up, and ordered size 12 and it fits well. i purchased the pink, and it's soo pretty! i'm very satisfied with my purchase, and i highly recommend this blouse.",5,12/08/2018
"Beautiful color, unflattering fit","Loved the color! loved the scallops! wish i loved it on me. the poplin fabric is very structured, which doesn't lend to a nice drape. the bottom hem was a little small for my curvy hips, so the top rode up a bit on me. looks lovely on a straighter figure, but wasn't amazing for me.",3,05/02/2018
Really cute top,"Love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris - felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small - i'm 5'7, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.",5,02/12/2018
Cute top!,"I debated getting this top, and i am glad that i did! i got the pink, and it is a fun, vibrant color. someone suggested that if you are in between sizes, go up. i agree with that feeling; however, it is pretty true to size. it is preppy, cute, and classic.",5,10/04/2018
Home run!,"While the white version is a tad more twee, this one in black is edgier, more sophisticated. tts for my 33"" chested, broad shouldered self in a 4. all the unique details add up to an outstanding, versatile piece: how it blouses out in back; opaque enough to wear without a cami; the scallops?i may keep both colors!",5,25/10/2018
"Beautiful color, odd fit","I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however, like many tops lately, it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.",3,01/10/2018
Boxy,"Very cute top and nice material, but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small, but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full, probably twice as full as seen in the pictures,which adds interest but was unexpected. also, the arm hole is wide, so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt, which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit, but i'm not sure about this one",3,07/09/2018
Elegant blouse,Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;),5,12/09/2018
"Classy, sophisticated",I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,5,02/10/2018
Beautiful shirt!,This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.,5,06/11/2018
Constricting,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.,2,29/07/2018
Weird construction,"I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through, but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size , not size 10 or 12, even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy , so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.",2,25/06/2018
Great cut,"Love this blouse. it has great coverage but is very light (yes it is a bit sheer, but with a nude bra you can't tell at all), so it's great for needing to look professional on hot summer days. the structure at the bust/waist creates a very flattering shape, and i love the bronze gold buttons with the black pattern. i got a 2 (usually a 0 but every once in a while i need to size up) and could've possibly gone with a 0, but am happy with the freedom of movement i have with the arms with the 2. ove",4,15/05/2018
Not flattering,"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. 

fit is tts.",1,13/08/2018
Size up!,"According to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10, but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage, the one spot i don't keep any fat. i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12, but i couldn't breath with the 12 on. for reference i am 34ddd. it was the 34 part that didn't fit, the ddd would have fit fine, i think.",3,11/11/2018
Great,"I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!",5,22/08/2018
Narrow in the middle,"I love the look of this blouse and i like the light weight material. it would require a camisole underneath but could be worn at the office or a night out. i purchased a size 4 and it fit perfect once i was able to get it on so i wouldn't want a larger size but because it doesn't button down all the way and it's so fitted in the waist it was nearly impossible to get it on and off over my shoulders, there's no give at all. sadly i'm going to have to return it.",4,25/01/2018
Pefect fit,"The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up.",5,15/03/2018
Totally sheer,"This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit, but not as a layering piece.",3,05/10/2018
Runs very small,"First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small, which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close, on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru, but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.",3,24/05/2018
Super cute,"If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite.",5,17/03/2018
Green perfection!,"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",5,29/08/2018
Cute top,"Great top, cuter in person with details than looks in picture. i found it to be true to size though i was worried it might be too boxy and wide. it was great, very cute! i do mostly plan on tucking it in with skirts.",5,22/08/2018
Super cute blouse,I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.,4,25/10/2018
This is green and runs large,Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).,4,05/02/2018
Great top,"Great top. i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice. she is 5'4"" and it reaches just the top of her jeans.",5,20/02/2018
Great going-out top!,"Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l",5,05/10/2018
Love,"I tried this top on in the store today and had to have it! i love the laces up the sides and the zipper in back. it is short - i found a really cute pair of ""baggy"" pants with a black pattern to pair with it.
in retailer shirts i wear an xs or s - or a 0 or 2. i got this in a 0 and it fit perfectly.",5,10/08/2018
"Beautiful, stylish, goes with everything","This is a cute,somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen, ties on the sides, and a zipper down the back. it'll go great with pants or skirts. the fit, though, is huge-- i'm normally an 8, but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says ""dry clean."" if it doesn't say ""dry clean only,"" you can wash it.",5,10/03/2018
If you have red hair you have to get this in kelly,"This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine, but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight, so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2.",5,06/02/2018
Nice blouse,Really like this blouse but am returning for a larger size. much too tight in the upper arms and somewhat tight in the chest - overall i like it.,4,25/01/2018
Gorgeous but tight on muscular arms.,"I bought this in both the navy (a more saturated blue in person - gorgeous!) and green, but both are going back. it fit everywhere but in the upper arms, even across my chest, and i usually encounter the opposite. i think it might just be the way it's cut across the shoulders that don't allow for much movement. so, while beautiful and so incredibly soft, it has to go back. (if you have slender arms, i think it would be a great fit.)",4,19/03/2018
Disappointed,I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.,1,06/07/2018
Close to perfect,"This is one of my favorite new retailer buys. originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire. the cut and design are great. for reference i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and a 34a. the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter, but the real winning feature(s) is the detail. so, so cute. only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily, but i'll deal with that for a cute form-fitting (but not too fitting!) top. .",5,17/04/2018
Cute blouse that runs small,The design is very cute. i'm glad i listened to reviews b/c this blouse definitely runs at least 2 sizes small maybe 3. i bought the blue and it's more of a navy blue instead of royal blue. at the sale price and additional 40% off (my daughter is an employee) i didn't mind paying $24 :).,4,10/08/2018
Pretty blouse that runs small,"The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse, and great quality.",3,02/10/2018
Very pretty!,"I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!",5,17/04/2018
Revealing,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.,3,23/04/2018
"Cute, flattering top","It's navy and red--the photo looked black to me. so i couldn't use with black skirt that i had planned to pair it with, but it's cute with jeans and maybe white shorts next summer. the front gapes open when you sit down, so i'll either have to pin it or sew a snap there unless i want the world to see my bra. also a little short waited for me--i'm 5""11"", so i wish the wrap hit a little lower, but not enough that i didn't keep it. it is flattering blouse. the shoulder ties add a little extra flair",4,02/03/2018
Loved but... horrible quality,"I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear, i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.",2,04/02/2018
Cute,Cute top. not sure about the tassels at the sleeves. very flattering in the waist area.,4,03/05/2018
Very elegant!,"I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8"" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.",5,01/04/2018
Amazing everything !!!,"First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said, i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to, dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap, paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well , i received it in the mail , and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art, as i see it as an exp",5,18/09/2018
So much prettier than pictured!,"I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10"", 135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed.",5,20/05/2018
Flirty and fun,"I am 5'5"", 145 lbs, a cup. depending on the style of the shirt i am between a medium and a small at retailer, in this case i purchased a small. even in the small the body has ample space which adds to the relax look without appearing sloppy. and because the shirt is wider i would say you can easily size down. the shirt is definitely flirty and fun with a great print, and easy to wear off of the shoulders. i invested in another retailer top that is also an ""off of the shoulder"" design but it does not",4,06/02/2018
Didn't try petite,"The heart version is very pretty, i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs, as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me, like 3/4 length, not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, and short.",5,27/09/2018
Surprisingly sweet,"Truthfully, i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist.",5,11/07/2018
So pretty in person!,"I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online, but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs, i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering.",5,18/09/2018
Pretty and comfortable,"Goes well with lots of skirts and pants, including the culottes shown. only downside, and not a big one, the sleeves are finished with elastic instead of a fabric band, which looks a little cheap",4,08/10/2018
Love this shirt,I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.,5,22/07/2018
Quirky & stylish silk shirt,"I must admit that i was a little hesitant to try this top on, largely due to my shape.
fyi: broad shoulders/back, 36c, short waist, 5'3"" 
typical size: dress or button-down shirt 12, knit or not fitted top, m
i purchased the heart design in a size m, since the upper part of the shirt is oversized a little bit (not too big and baggy, though) and then narrowis to the waist. think ""upside-down triangle"", as the shape of the top. since this is also my shape on top (6 on bottom), i worried that th",5,11/04/2018
Feminine & fun,"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..",5,03/09/2018
Fall must have,"Beautiful fall colors, perfect with work pants or jeans. i'm tall and was a little worried it would be too short, but it was a good fit.",5,11/06/2018
Great quality,"I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that, but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the",4,11/08/2018
Beautiful fabric great for spring,I was very impressed with the quality of the satin. this top can easily be dressed up or down. i purchased the white and love it! the almost full zip back makes for easy on and off. i ordered a medium and think it runs a little big.,4,29/01/2018
Skylar buttondown,"The fit is slightly loose, but figure flattering, the fabric is semi sheer and the light, coral color is very pretty. however, after one, short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately, i need to return this blouse asap.",3,25/02/2018
"Beautiful, poor quality","I love this blouse, i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric, so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners! 

retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.",3,31/10/2018
"Adorable and comfortable, poor fabric quality","I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. 

but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different",1,20/10/2018
Love this blouse,This blouse is wonderful. i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today. i received so many compliments. i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it.,5,18/10/2018
Black and white shirt,This shirt is even prettier in person. it's really flowy but still very flattering.,5,20/07/2018
A little on the short side,"I purchased this top in the wine color and found it to be cute and comfortable. the sleeves are not tight which is nice, but it is very short and moving your arms away from our sides make this shirt look a little bit like a tent. the color is pretty and the button detail is nice.
overall good purchase, but i'm glad i got it on sale!",4,24/07/2018
Overall a great shirt,"I noted that this runs large- i should say it runs wide. it is supposed to be flowy like in the picture, but i am really swimming in the l. that being said, i worry that if i returned for a m that it would be too short in the front. i am 5'10 for reference, and i would say the length in front is a little shorter than i would like, but it still works. the black and white print is beautiful- i paired it today with dark skinny jeans and received compliments. other reviews about the batwing sleeves",4,06/12/2018
"Beautiful design; but, disappointing quality","It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however, the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store, unfortunately.",2,14/10/2018
Bof. (aka meh),"As the other reviewer said, this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer, and i am short... i tried on xxs regular, xs petite and xs regular.

xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders, cehst), but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular, a bit longer, but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this, but probably something beter wil lcome along.

great for those who want to show their assets",3,02/11/2018
Pretty,"This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5'3"" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe",5,19/06/2018
Very flattering fit,I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.,5,15/11/2018
Simply floaty,"I purchased the white in the store in a size 6. 34d. i ordered the black online in a 6 and the lining was a bit snug. (i can maybe remove the black lining) however, i really like how the peplum looks. the v neck and bra friendly design are a perfect marriage. i see wearing these through the fall with a denim jacket or cardigan. for now i am enjoying how floaty and feminine i feel. i think this is a perfect top for women with a larger chest as it gives a nice shape but doesn't look maternity or b",4,06/03/2018
Scratchy gauze,"I am ever in search of a light, white, summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers, and each of them is the scratchy, starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.",3,28/04/2018
"Flowwy, comfortable, feminine","I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt, or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops, although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium, and it fits perfect.",5,12/09/2018
Simply gorgeous!!,"Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested, you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe.",5,12/02/2018
You need this.,"Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on, but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me",5,03/03/2018
Love retailer's tunics,"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",5,06/04/2018
Bought this in both colors!,"Love this top, super soft and drapes great, even after washing. it is pretty long and loose, but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers!",5,25/07/2018
Perfect fall shirt,Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.,5,26/11/2018
Easy,"Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color.",5,10/10/2018
Great tunic,"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!",5,07/11/2018
Love it,"Pretty blues! colors are exactly as pictured! fits perfectly; not boxy, not tight, just comfortable! i'm 5'9 and this is tunic length on me!",5,22/05/2018
Perfect fall tunic,"I love everything about this tunic : the color, fabric and design! i am very happy with this perches!",5,24/08/2018
Super cute top!,"I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back, but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!",5,22/09/2018
Love,"It's perfect. perfect fit, long enough to wear leggings and cover my behind. it's perfect.",5,23/07/2018
Great top!,"I love this top. i am 5'8"", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!",5,07/06/2018
Love this!,"This shirt is comfortable, loose, but doesn't make you look like you're shapeless. it compliments.",5,28/02/2018
"Fun, colorful top","Top was featured in an email ad. i love the colors in both tops and bought both plaids. i'm 5'4"", about 130 lbs, and the medium fits well. it is long in the back, but i like that. if the front were a little longer, i'd prefer that, but the length is ok. the colors are definitely cheery and mood-enhancing, very appropriate for this holiday season.",4,15/05/2018
Cute style but too small for me,"Had to return for a larger size. like the design, though. quality wasn't as expected but since i purchased on sale, i decided not to return the top but exchange for a larger size which i hope is still available.",4,26/10/2018
Flutter poplin top,"This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste, it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand, usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top",3,15/11/2018
Statement blouse,"I love this summery blouse. it sits at high hip, so no tucking in! the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm. i own this same pattern in a knit, and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it. the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater.",5,16/05/2018
Bee-utiful,Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.,5,09/10/2018
Cute and nice cut,"This is a nice sleeveless button down, the bee design is really fun, but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought. i tried it on with a pair of white shorts, with a half tuck, and it looked great. i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans. nice addition. i purchased the 0 (or xs?) my usual size, in regular length, and it was fine. the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants. i am 115 lbs for reference and 30 dd.",5,30/04/2018
Fun and unique,"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!",5,28/06/2018
All the buzz,This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.,5,22/02/2018
"Cute, printed blouse!","This blouse is very cute and will be great for summer casual wear! so cute in this print - it looks great with colored crop pants!

it is a bit tough to get the right fit in this top, depending on your preference. i usually wear a size 2-4 in tops (26"" waist, 34b/c), but went with a 0 in this because it just felt wide otherwise. also, i am fine with it, but this blouse seems to be somewhat short in the torso. if you are particular, possibly buy in store because the pattern of bees varies quite",4,03/12/2018
Best if tied at waist,"Love the fabric of this button-down. runs really large, however. am usually a small or xs - so bought a 4. it's ok, but is incredibly boxy and stands away from the body -- & not in a good way. i think it probably works well tied at the waist, but, alas -- i am too old to be showing off that part of my anatomy. returned reluctantly! hope others will enjoy!",4,31/07/2018
Bumble bees,"This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldn't be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise, i'm thrilled.",5,09/05/2018
A special piece,"Upon entering a local retailer store, i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on. 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist, 5'3"" (almost), and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted, button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one, but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be ""loose-fitting"". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12, but it was too big in the armholes and chest, causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10, these",5,28/01/2018
Cute and professional look,Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.,5,24/07/2018
Lovely material,"At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of",5,29/01/2018
Love it!,"I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. 

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!",5,04/08/2018
Off the shoulder elastic issues,"The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized , therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders , the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .",3,17/04/2018
Wanted to love it,"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",2,12/07/2018
A flattering peplum top,"I had been eyeballing this for a very long time because i loved the look of the skirt and this top (of which i snagged the skirt when it went on sale). i was delighted to finally take a chance and buy this when it went on sale, too. thoughts below:
______
pros:
- it is well made and on the thicker side. 
- for a peplum, it is actually slimming. i am an hourglass and with hips, which usually means such tops flare out so much making me look wider in all the wrong places. so i was skeptical abo",4,10/11/2018
Good quality,I was looking for a good navy top for the spring/summer to wear with white denim for a nautical look. this top is perfect and i especially like the neck for when its cooler in the evenings.,4,07/10/2018
Cute top,"This top is really cute and can be worn off shoulder or not.  the embroidery is really pretty.  my only comment would be the top is shorter than i expected, if you wear it off shoulder its of course longer but still shorter than i would have preferred.  keeping it anyways as it will be a fun going out casual top.",4,27/09/2018
Super cute summer top!,"I just got this top in the mail and love love love it! i thought it was on the pricey side for a shirt, but couldn't help but purchase it full price because i love anything pineapple print! the metallic print is cute and chic from day to night. i also love the open shoulders, making this design different and perfect for summer. i'm only sorry that i didn't see this top online until i already returned from my vacation in maui! very comfortable and easy, worth the price!",5,15/05/2018
Beautiful,I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.,5,10/03/2018
True to size and reversible,"I was leary about ordering this but absolutely loved it when it arrived!  i found out the front could be the back and the back could be the front - reversible, right?  and the styling of the shirt was very complimentary to my body.",5,01/02/2018
Beautiful,Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.,5,28/10/2018
Interesting piece,"The design is unique and stands out.  goes great with a black pair of jeans and can be dressed up.  i found the fit to be decent - not unflattering on me. however, i suspect that it could run short / tight on others.

overall though - a cute white top for winter.",4,13/04/2018
Unique,"This sweatshirt is beautiful and a step beyond the ordinary. the white is crisp and the lace is just beautiful. the black striping is subtle and really attractive. i had a problem with the fit. it just grabbed my mid section in an unattractive way. i wear large in more fitted items and that's what i ordered this time. i'm well endowed and it fit nicely over my bust, shoulders and arms so afraid the next size up will be too big. although it didn't work for me i highly recommend this beautiful top",4,29/01/2018
"Adorable, crisp top","I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.

i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.",5,25/06/2018
I don't think this is an off the shoulder top,"Bought this and tried it on in the store. when i first tried it on, i thought it was off the shoulder but the elastic is so tight, it hurt within a minute of having it on. i got my usual size xs and it fits fine if i wear this as a regular top and not off the shoulder. it has a thin elastic, not the thicker band. maybe some could pull this off for off the shoulder but in my opinion, it's not comfortable that way. i bought the other white off the shoulder top from retailer last month and it's fine",4,29/07/2018
Fun trend splurge,"This top is my fun splurge for the summer. it's a little flowy but not over the top. and the quality is great. 

i'm 5""7, 120lb with really broad swimmer shoulders. i preferred the xs because it was a little bit less flowy on the sides than the s. but the length on the xs is dramatically shorter than s, so i went with the s.",4,06/07/2018
Lovely in lace,"Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic, comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.",5,03/11/2018
Too big!,"I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.",2,21/02/2018
Runs huge,This top runs 2 full sizes large. had to send back and didn?t want to bother with getting a new one.,3,18/02/2018
Cute summer top!,"I bought this at the store today and it's the perfect summer top! i'm not going to pull it off my shoulders, so it's a little shorter than shown here. but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy. it will go with so many things! very well made, thickish material.",5,30/07/2018
Very well made top,I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.,5,29/10/2018
Cute in theory,"Cute in theory, i love the bright colors, the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe, however, the fabric is cheap, and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional, but with the shirt i received, it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam, so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on",2,20/02/2018
Fun & different,"I love the colors in this top. the black tie makes this top different from anything else in my closet. the cut accentuates my shoulders, which i like. i usually wear a petite small, so i ordered this in an extra small and it fits nicely. the fabric could be a bit softer, but i still really like this top. it's unique and very feminine.",4,23/09/2018
Strange fit,"For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and",2,27/05/2018
Gorgeous and feminine,"I love this top but make sure to size down! i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent! returned for an xs. overall, the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning. the orange isn't too harsh. a keeper for sure!",5,08/12/2018
Beautiful top,"This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.",5,04/12/2018
Classic & elegant,This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.,5,11/07/2018
Versatile blouse,"I just got it in the mail and i love it! very versatile piece. wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt. i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans. i am 5'5"" ,125lbs , a 32dd and wear a size 4 or 27 in jeans.",5,05/12/2018
What a stunning top!,"I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2"", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself",5,08/08/2018
Sizing is good,"I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots.",5,08/07/2018
Cute shirt,"Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!",5,01/11/2018
In love!,"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",5,30/01/2018
Nice enough,"I liked the top, it is cute, but i didn't keep it as i have similar tops like it and i had better options. however:

color: it is true that htere are differentials in the coloring of fabrics in this top, but that is not necessairly a bad thing, it kind of gives t personality.

lace part (this is where i have a similr one, tank all alce like that): darker ivory, drkest part of hte shirt. cut to neck is flatetering, and different from the low lunging things we see a lot of.

body: true to size, i",4,01/07/2018
Too short again!,"Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point, it probably has to go back :(",5,04/04/2018
Lovely,"This top is so pretty! i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special. it's true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style. i didn't find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line (i'm 5'10""). i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly! i know this will be one piece i wear quite often!",5,17/04/2018
Disappointing,Loved how this top looked online and couldn't wait to get it. i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online. i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off. this is going back!,2,04/08/2018
Full but pretty,"I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it.",5,25/11/2018
"Great details, on trend","I fell in love with this top online. i am obsessed with the little flounce detail on the sleeve and the slight a-line shape of the body. i was able to try it on in store and was glad i did because i ended up sizing up to a small from my usually x-small. i still put ""true to size"" because i think the forgiving cut allows the top to work in multiple sizes. i even tried on a medium and it still looked like it fit. the arms are a bit tight, as the other reviewer mentioned so keep in mind when choosi",4,18/11/2018
Retailer at its best!,"On any given day, i can usually find tons of stuff i like at retailer, but every once in a while comes an item that is extra special.

it has adorable details, lovely print, fits beautifully and can't be found anywhere else. oh, and the quality is good. 

this top is it for me!

i love the print, and the sleeves remind me a bit of a kimono except that this top's fabric is smooth and flowy.

i tried the top in the store in a small, and i felt lost in the fabric (i am 5'4"", 115# and small on",5,19/07/2018
Very pretty blouse; sleeves impractical,"I normally wear an xl, but could only find this instore in size large. the blouse fits nicely, but i think it would come down a bit lower and also be a longer blouse if i would have purchased it in my usual size. the blouse itself has a nice drape to it. the black 'railroad tracks' look very pretty in person, and add a nice detail. the only complaint i have with this blouse is the sleeves. the enormous bell sleeve feels like a costume. but for a nominal fee i had the sleeves shortened to a ruffl",4,30/07/2018
Perfect peasant top,"This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me, i am 5""3' and about 120 lbs, the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low",5,28/01/2018
Odd style,"I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. 
if you have a tiny head and pencil a",1,18/10/2018
Sad top.,"I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.",2,31/05/2018
Fit is unflattering,"I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.",2,20/06/2018
Very versatile,I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,5,16/03/2018
Back pleats are never a good idea,"This shirt is gorgeous at first glance. the quality is there and it has a beautiful design...from the front, that is. but it is huge and billowy with back pleats. i cannot imagine this being flattering on anyone. it just adds so much volume to the top. i am thin and petite so maybe that was the issue, but i just can't see adding so much volume. this was a total miss for me. such a shame. would have been great without all the extra volume in back.",3,02/12/2018
Lovely if you don't have curves!,"The lace detail on this blouse is beautiful. i love that it is cotton and it has a detachable camisole which is a nice touch. unfortunately, this didn't work for me as i found it extremely unflattering. the gathered material just doesn't work if you have a large bust. it made me look enormous, which is never a good feeling. i recommend, but only for tall, slim types with a small bust.",4,23/11/2018
"Loved this blouse, just not on me","I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful, and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well, which is not a given for this style top, and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions, and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length, not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs and tried a size s.",3,14/04/2018
Beautiful blouse; not good for full figures,"I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice, sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender, the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note, this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri",3,22/02/2018
Great features but too boxy,I loved the color of the top and the faded look but unfortunately had to return it because it was too boxy and just looked frumpy,4,26/06/2018
One of the cutest tops i have for this summer!,I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!,5,23/04/2018
So much fabric...,"The picture of this top is misleading. it's more like a tent/ super short dress. i ordered my usual size (l) and could easily get away with a small in this top, if the arm holes were not too tight. i def. need to go down to a medium, and maybe even a petite medium since i'm 5/3. the top is 100% cotton, but there is so much fabric there is no way a little shrinkage would offset the amount of extra fabric. it looks like a tent on. plus, the picture and description make it seem like a normal top le",3,15/02/2018
Love but a little too much flow,"I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy"".",3,01/04/2018
Great top!,Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!,5,30/05/2018
Fun top!,I got the blue and love the color. it's bigger than it looks here! almost like the model has it pinned in the back...but it's swingy and super cute and fun!!,5,06/08/2018
"Well made, long and flowing","This elegant-with-a-slight-edge top has a lovely neckline and is very comfortable. i chose the denim/blue version, which i wouldn't wear with jeans, but it's great with crops. i imagine it will be a good layering piece in the fall. it's long, but not long enough to be a dress. overall, it's flattering and slightly structured up top with tiny buttons at the back of the neck?generous and full below.",5,04/02/2018
Way too long!,This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.,2,21/08/2018
Love this top,I paired this top with pants and cardi from retailer and have really enjoyed wearing this outfit. i usually wear a large but due to how much material there is and how flowy it is i sized down to a m and it fits perfectly. only down side is getting the buttons buttoned behind your neck.,4,07/09/2018
Well made and pretty!,"I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans, khaki shorts, and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!",5,18/10/2018
Too flowy and too washed out,This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!,2,17/10/2018
So pretty!,"I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty, and while it's very lightweight, it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.",5,16/06/2018
Sweet briar tank,The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.,5,30/03/2018
Love!,This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.,5,10/05/2018
"Cute tank, great details","This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck, but i assume that will get easier with time.",4,17/10/2018
Recommend with one comment,"I usually wear a medium but in this top probably could have pulled off a small however i was afraid the neck would be too tight.  was considering the small because the arm holes were a bit baggier than i would like.  no issue with my bra showing though.  i wasn't able to try on the small to test my theory since i purchased online.  overall i love the color (blue), the fabric is comfortable, definitely loose but i'm okay with that on a hot sunny day.",4,05/10/2018
Fits very small,"I loved the design of the top! it looks great in person too. i am typically a size 12 top, and i ordered a size l. i could barely get the top on, and once on, it was super tight around my armpit area and waist. i am going to exchange it for an xl and hope that that will fit. the fabric has no give or stretch; it is tight fitting. underneath the ruffles the top looks like a halterneck tank top style.",3,10/08/2018
A tad thin and see through,"I tried on xs petites as someone had returned it . i didn't find that it ran small, it was ok on me. i am not sure if the regular size would work but i didn't end up purchasing this today as the color was jsut so-so on my skin tone.

likes: contrast and detail in ruffle, romantic

dislikes: the tag pulled on the fabric a bit and you could tell, so the fabric seemed fragile.",4,06/10/2018
Beautiful top - runs large,"I ordered a m and l based on the reviews - and both were too big. this is a drapey top with large arm(pit) openings.
i have since ordered a small and hope this fits well.
in general, this top is beautiful.
i usually wear a 4/6 or s/m top/blouse and am 5'8"" with a slim build. the m should have fit better than it did.",4,21/07/2018
Strangly clingy,"I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not, but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric, the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.",3,08/06/2018
Short mumu,"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

Fabulously comfortable and stylish,Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!,5,24/02/2018
Bettors off the shoulder top is a must!,"I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.",5,15/03/2018
Cute but....,"I purchased this top online, love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also, it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall, cute item and fabric but definitely order down!!",4,21/07/2018

Pretty and casual top,"I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp), so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual, it gives a nice ""dress-up"" kick to any jeans, shorts, capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate

Better in person; size up,"This is a really adorable top!normally i shop online, but ended up in a store today. i bought it instantly, but never would have purchased this based upon the pictures. as all the other reviewers have said, this does run small and you need to size up, especially if you are busty for your size. i am a 4 or a small  (34c) in just about everything, but had to go to a medium. the sleeves attach too far out on the front of the top, restricting arm movement. thankfully, i didn't see a significant size",4,01/05/2018
Too boxy,"This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality, but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big. 

the fit is tts, though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.",3,04/12/2018
Tight in the chest,"I'm 5'2 and based on some other reviews i opted for the regular rather than petite and am glad i did. even the regular is kind of short. if i raise my arm(s) all the way up, skin is typically exposed. i originally ordered a medium and i liked the fit everywhere except for the chest. i'm a 34dd and i felt like i couldn't move my arms. i exchanged it for a large to sacrifice some of the fit for some more arm movement. the cut is already a bit boxy so having it a bit boxier with more arm movement w",4,21/08/2018
"So cute, but tricky fit","This top is adorable and looked pretty on, but when i raised my arms the top wanted to rise up and then stay there above the breast level. it didn't settle back into place when i lowered my arms. maybe a larger size would have helped, but then it would have been a boxy fit. i also found it hard to take off, even with the button on the back of the neckline. the length is cropped, so you would want to wear it with a high-waisted skirt or pants. i like the details in the fabric a lot, but i didn't",4,16/04/2018
Short wasted and fun,"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however, the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3"" , 118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer, and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace.",4,07/07/2018
Adorable but runs small,"I agree with others that this top runs small. i am usually a 2/4 in retailer tops and the small was very tight around the chest area. however, it looked so cute on! i wanted to buy it so badly, but it just didn't work for me. the design is absolutely adorable but i could not lift my arms without the whole top riding up. they did not have a medium in the store so i couldn't see if a larger size would work. overall, such a cute top, just not appropriate for someone my age or practical for someone ch",4,14/11/2018
Very femenine and pretty!,"Well, i totally disagree with the previous reviewer on this one! i think this top is very pretty. yes, it does hide any flaws in the tummy, but it is not wide nor does it make you look pregnant (side or front view). i am 5 ft, 2 inches, broad shouldered, 36c and the small fit nicely (i usually wear a small to medium in retailer tops). i am thinking of purchasing the xs as there is still plenty of room around the chest/arm area. the lace is pretty, looks good worn with a dark colored pant. the only",4,10/10/2018

Too big,I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.,3,04/11/2018
So flattering,Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.,5,20/07/2018
Too ruffly,"I had high hopes for this top, as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!",3,25/11/2018
Such a cute top!,"Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers",5,19/04/2018
Interesting,"Love the block appearance. looks exactly like on the model ! material again could have been better. dry clean only, so expensive wear. price per wear may be high due to that as each time you dry clean price actually goes up and use goes down.",4,01/09/2018

So much cuter than picture!!,"I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it.  they were talking about how cute it was (they didn't have it in the store).  i asked what size it was and it was a medium, so i said i want to try it on.  after trying it on, i fell in love, it is so cute, the cut fit great.  it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust.  if you are in between sizes, you can probably size down.  i wore it yest",5,15/11/2018
Pretty blouse!,"I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a",5,08/07/2018
My favorite new blouse,"This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.",5,21/03/2018
Very interesting design,"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.",5,05/04/2018
Beautiful fabric,This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.,5,13/11/2018
Could have been cute...,"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

"Beautiful top, looks great with black/gray jeans","I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.",5,06/05/2018

Worth thr $$$,This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.,5,19/05/2018

Love this blouse!,Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.,5,20/11/2018
Shrinks,I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,1,22/05/2018
Cute top!,This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.,5,10/08/2018
Love this blouse,"Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,",5,03/09/2018
"Beautiful top, but it shrank substantially!","This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size, but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.",3,04/04/2018
Gorgeous top!,"I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge",5,06/09/2018
Very pretty,"I bought this blouse on sale in a medium because it was the last one left in the store. i usually wear a large, but surprisingly it fit. i'm a woman of color, and the off white and lace looks great with my complexion. i got many compliments on the blouse as i made my way to the register to check out. i can't wait to wear it this spring. i'll have to be careful when wearing this blouse because one good snag with a fingernail, or necklace and the lace will be torn. other than that, i'm very happy",4,21/03/2018
Bright and airy!,"The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!",5,01/04/2018
Beautiful,This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.,5,31/10/2018
Greenhouse tank,I loved this top . it is beautiful.,5,21/04/2018
Pleasing spring floral print,The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.,5,14/10/2018
Gorgeous spring blouse!,"So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.",5,13/06/2018
Dissapointed,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.,3,30/10/2018
Cute and different!,"More flattering than it looks on the model. comes in at the waist on me. i ordered it in blue, and it's very pretty; will go nice with a business suit but requires a cami underneath for work occasions.",4,31/10/2018
Pretty,"The colors on this are beautiful! i have wider hips and thighs and this blouse just looks too boxy on me. i ordered a size down and from that aspect it fit. however, it is too flowy and boxy for my body type. i considered keeping it for layering but even on sale, it is too expensive for this purpose. i'm so bummed because the colors are so pretty!",4,15/05/2018
Nightbelle halter top,"Very cute on, fits well. versatile top, i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.",5,09/07/2018
Beautiful but strange back design,"This top is very pretty and looks expensive and as pictured
nice pattern and could be dressed up or down
the gathered neck is beautiful and has a bit if a stretch 
however, the back of the top has strange bat wing-like design element that seem unnecessary and distract from the elegance of the rest if the top
sadly, i think i may send it back.",4,07/07/2018
Beautiful - the first time you wear it.,"This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno",2,13/04/2018
Simple yet charming,"I really wish i could keep this top. the material is okay and i have noticed with this brand, shirts made from this material do not wash well or look that nice after a wash. if you have the time to dry clean then i would 100% recommend this top. another tip if you buy this (since i didn't read the description) the top has buttons all down the front. i am not a fan of button tops because i have a larger chest so i wouldn't recommend this top to someone who is busty.",3,06/02/2018
Stunningly beautiful,"I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31"" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro",5,24/07/2018
Classic flannel,"This is a simplistic beauty. the colors are lovely and as pictured. i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size. i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it. the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall, winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate.",5,26/03/2018
Lovely top for fuller figures,"Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it's one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit.",5,26/10/2018
Nellore blouse for the win!,"This blouse is stunning. i have been wanting it for some time. i finally broke down and purchased it. i am 5' 8"" and about 160lbs. i generally wear size l /size 10. i bought this in a large. i need a medium for sure. i could get away with the large, but it's very flowy. i think the med will be more flattering. i am planning to exchange for a smaller size. i would recommend this blouse for sure. if you want it, buy it. it's often times sold out.",5,20/11/2018
Very pretty!,"I purchased this blouse over the summer and it's very pretty. i love the cap sleeves with the lace and the detail in the front. it can be dressed up or dressed down, my only complaint is that it wrinkles very easily.",4,01/08/2018
Shrunk!,"I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.",3,22/11/2018
Well made and flattering,The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.,5,26/04/2018
Great details and fit!,"Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!",5,11/04/2018
Great details,"I got this shirt in black, and it's perfect for the office. i ordered a medium, which i thought was a little on the larger side. well made, the details make it an interesting top.",5,10/08/2018
"Fun, neutral layering piece","This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it's definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.",5,27/10/2018
"Cute, work appropriate top","Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute, work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.",4,30/07/2018
Gorgeous and unique,"I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo",5,25/06/2018
"Oh dear, no!","Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.",1,20/02/2018
Perfect tenfold,"This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al",5,09/04/2018
Perfect summer top,I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.,5,15/11/2018
Love it!,I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,5,22/07/2018
Great for leggings,"I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference, i'm 5'.4.5"", 150 lbs, 34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months, this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas, i can get away wearing it even in colder months.",4,24/10/2018
Beautiful top,"This top definitely looks better in person. i thought it looked pretty online, but when i tried it on, it looked even better! this top is on the longer side and fits like it looks on the model. the fabric is perfect in my opinion because i don't have to 1) dry clean it, 2) iron it, or 3) worry about it itching or bothering my skin. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i purchased a size xs and it drapes wonderfully. i love the crochet around the neckline, the 3/4 length sleeves, and the colors of the",5,04/06/2018
"Love, love, love!","Saw this top online and immediately had to purchase it! the first time i wore it i received many compliments... even my husband commented how cute it is. as shown in the photo, the back is longer than the front. i am 5'6"" and my top fell as the model's does. love this top and so happy with my purchase! i bought a size small, i normally wear medium or small tops. fit runs a little large, but small fit perfect!",5,18/06/2018
Adore! fancy!,"I love this top, it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small, it is true to size. very classy!!",5,07/03/2018
Very pretty in person,"The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4, which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips, but the shape worked well for my shape.",5,11/05/2018
A perfect white top,"A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.",5,20/08/2018
Just lovely,I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.,5,20/06/2018
Easy breezy :),Gorgeous top! very beautiful and easy. can be dressed up for work or just worn with a pair of jeans. note the fabric is semi sheer so a nude bra or cami is a must with this but it's going to be fantastic for summer!,4,12/07/2018
Really beautiful.....,"I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions, i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options, but alas, there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work, or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute, you won't regret it! (as a side note, it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)",5,22/04/2018
Love this,"For some reason they are not replenishing this shirt even though it sells out like wildfire. 
i got a small even though i was pretty sure i needed an extra small. this shirt is pretty wide, not prohibitively wide but not a fitted shirt by any means. i'd love to get this in my size if they ever opt to sell more in the ivory.",5,07/12/2018
Beautiful,"This top is unique and beautiful but the fit does not work for me. i am tall with broad shoulders. the shoulder and upper arm areas are too tight, but the rest of the top is loose and flowy, so if i go up a size it will be too wide. the length and arms are also much shorter on me than pictured. i don't see this in the description but it comes with a cream colored cami layer, and the sleeves have a roll/button tab function. the brand is meadow rue. this will be really pretty on someone more petit",4,18/11/2018
Happy birthday to me!,"Another winner for me! this top drapes wonderfully, the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on! i would highly recommend it!",5,25/03/2018
Beautiful detail but delicate,"The detail on the fabric of this blouse is beautiful and unique, especially the peachy/pink and orange detailing which is hard to see in the picture. the fabric and seam are quite delicate though so it just needs to be worn and handled with care. fits true to size. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c and the small is perfect.",4,01/09/2018
Better in person,I probably would have never purchased this blouse is i had only seen it online. but i was at our local store looking for something else and spotted it hanging all the way on the other end of the store. a salesperson encouraged me to try it on and it is beautiful! it can easily be dressed up or down. you can tie the bow in multiple ways or leave it hanging. it is sheer but the pattern obscures the transparency so no camisole is needed. it embraces the 70's vibe in a modern way. i absolutely love,4,25/02/2018
Wish it were made out of cotton,"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",1,29/10/2018
Piece didn't make sense,This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.,2,18/07/2018
Beautiful detail!,"I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.",5,28/06/2018
Nice top - runs small,"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully, i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference, i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. also, the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said.",4,01/07/2018
Stunning!,"Ordered this top the second i saw it!
i wear a small or med. depending on the cut and fabric............noticed it is cotton and went with a medium.
so happy i went with the larger size.......runs very small, especially in the chest, and there is no give in the fabric.
stunning top but would go up one, possibly two sizes.",5,24/07/2018
Very pretty and very lightweight fabric,Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned,3,09/06/2018
In love with nala!,"I paired this gorgeous top with a black v-neck cardigan, mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazing...i honestly lost count of the compliments that i received!!  beading is sewn on tightly, and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends.  i am 5'3""/108 and took the regular size small.  highly recommend!!",5,11/04/2018
Too loose at bottom,"This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous, very stunning, but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom, made me feel like i had a big tummy, and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.",3,15/10/2018
Beautiful blouse with lovely cotton-lace detail,"I bought this blouse in ivory, which is almost white, just as pictured. it's pretty sheer (as shown in the pics) and the cotton lace insets show the top and straps of my bra. despite this, i'm keeping the blouse and will sort out how to wear it because it's so unusual and gorgeous! if black looks good on you (it's bad on me), i'd probably go with that colorway over the ivory because it's easier to blend a black bra with a black blouse than a nude bra with an almost white blouse. the blouse runs",4,14/10/2018
"Perfect style, will be a favorite",This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am,5,24/06/2018
Lovely tunic,"Well-made and well-designed tunic top. looks great over pants. not recommended for tucking in, as the pin tucks hit right at the waistline. the ivory is a bit see-through so i wear it with a cami underneath. be aware that your bra will likely be visible through the cut-outs in front. i didn't realize that the first time i wore it and was amazed to discover, at the end of the evening, how tacky it looked. to avoid that you need a low-cut bra. with the proper undergarments, this is a great top tha",4,04/07/2018
Grab it while you can!,"I actually paid full price for this over the winter and i'm not sorry i did. great top w/lovely fabric. i usually wear a small but in this top, an xs, so it runs a bit large.",5,18/02/2018
Beautiful,This blouse looks even better in person. it fits true to size and is lightweight. i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering. i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it.,5,20/03/2018
Pretty print!!!,"Today was my first visit to our new store! the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors. many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not. if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts, order medium.",5,06/09/2018
Universal top,"I'm not sure why it's considered a ""blue motif,"" i think it's more on the black and cream side. other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather, it's lightweight and airy and you'll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath. looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work. i'm 5'7"" and almost 130 lbs with a 34a bust and a small fit great.",5,16/09/2018
Pretty pleasant,I like this on the model so i ordered it. it is not quite as deep in color as online but still pretty. it fits well not too loose and not tight at all. i will get great use out of this all the way through spring!,4,20/08/2018
Great top for spring and summer,I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.,5,26/05/2018
Beautiful,"Rec'd so many compliments on this.  absolutely beautiful, comfortable and versatile.  try it with white crops and cute heels!",5,15/10/2018
Super cute,This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!,5,18/06/2018
Unique and good quality,"The material used is soft and breezy and good for summer.the design is unique and catchy. the two cons its dry clean and runs very large. i normally wear m from retailer and this top in ""s"" still too roomy. since its for summer, i'm keeping it as it is.",4,08/06/2018
Great style,"This pull over is so easy to wear, very comfortable and has a great bohemian vibe. it's quality seems higher than what i was expecting- lots of details, tassels, fringe and hood. i travel a lot for work internationally and it's become my go-to for the plane, dinners and excursions- makes a boring outfit looks effortlessly cool. would love to see more items like this pullover in the store this fall.",5,03/04/2018
Great piece,"This pullover is perfect for spring all the way into fall. it is comfortable and the perfect piece to throw on over a summery tank and jeans. i've even worn it over dresses before and it worked great. soft fabric, but durable. i've had a lot of compliments on this pullover and recommend it for you!",5,20/02/2018
Beautiful blouse,"True to size, nice unique shoulder/neckline fit and blousey/full on the bottom and arms which taper in. for me, i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition. though a vest or belt can also be used. sheer, you will need a cami. lovely flow and colors., the collar,pleats and neck tie add a romantic interest. just beautiful.",5,27/04/2018
Very nice blouse!,"Received this blouse to wear for the holidays and was not disappointed. the design of the shirt is to be relaxed and flowing. i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered. the shirt fit fine but i probably could of managed with a small if i did not want it as relaxed. so if you are between sizes, you might want to size down. if i did order a small, the sleeves might of been a tad short since i have longer arms. the shirt is sheer, so you will need a cami underneath. i wore a black one which w",4,06/10/2018
"Very pretty, too blousy","This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage, romantic looking fabric. the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely. i love the colors...black, brown, and cream. it's hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown. the long tie adds a romantic feel. this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank. i actually love the blouse, but returned it because it is super blousy. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., and the small was fine. it is just so blousy, that even belting it didn",5,09/07/2018
Almost a winner,"There was only a l in store but i tried it as a gauge. given i am normally a xs/0, i knew it was going to be too big but wanted to see if i could get an idea of how it might look in my regular size. it truly is a lovely blouse - gauzy fabric, flowy feel and an easy piece to dress up or down. however the xs was much shorter in the sleeves, (above the wrist bone on me), and much shorter in the body, (sat at mid pelvis - for ref i am 5'7""). this completely altered the look and i think i would have",4,13/05/2018
Love this blouse,"This blouse is gorgeous, i purchased in two colors and absolutely love it. just a side note i normally wear a size small blouse or size 4-6 blouse, in this i went up a size and purchased the medium.",5,06/06/2018
Beautiful blouse can be tucked in or left out,"I bough this in the blue green color and it's absolutely beautiful -- just as it appears online. actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online -- it's fitted up top and flowy everywhere else. this may be because i'm fairly straight-figured -- it's possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust. i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily. i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s, and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits. note: in meadow rue",5,13/10/2018
Perfect blouse!,"This blouse makes me feel young, vibrant, and beautiful! i got it in (2) colors with the coupon special. i love how it fits and it's slimming! love it. i have broad shoulders, and it is very slimming.",5,29/06/2018
Put a stop to this top,"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work"", lastly the",1,08/11/2018
Sweet,"I recently purchased this blouse in black. i love the soft yet crepe like fabric and the small bit of negative space trim just above the bust line gives it an air of elegance. comfortable and breathable, i see this becoming a ""how did i live without this"" staple.",5,15/02/2018
Do not wash!,"True to size until it met the laundry! let my disappointment be a lesson -- $80 for a blouse that i no longer recognize. i washed this item as indicated by the care instructions and it shrunk by at least 30%. dry clean this garment, or spot clean at best.",3,07/04/2018
Great blouse,"In love with this blouse, i first got in ivory went back and got in black, you can dress casual or up.",5,18/07/2018
Cute yet super wrinkly,"Super cut but easily wrinkles. eg. i ironed it, got dressed, then bent down to tie my daughters shoe and the whole front bottom was super wrinkly. i thought that it'd go away but it didn't... just got worse by the time i got out of my car at work... front and back were noticeably wrinkled all day.",3,26/03/2018
Great blouse for any occasion,"Great fit, looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.",5,22/01/2018
Lovely top,I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.,5,06/07/2018
Great work top,"I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white, and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated, it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost, but on sale, it's a great shirt.",5,03/12/2018
Lovely blouse,This top is so much cuter in person. it's light and airy and very feminine. can be worn casually or dressed up. definitely not as full/baggy as it appears in the photo.,5,14/11/2018
Love it!,"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently, and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality, not overly delicate, and beautiful detail.",5,24/03/2018
Love this top,"This top arrived by mail this morning, it is beautiful even prettier than the picture. fits true to size and is wonderful quality. cannot wait to wear it when i leave on vacation this weekend.",5,14/08/2018
Well made top,"I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.",5,15/11/2018
Pretty but,"This was a miss for me. the armholes are too low, it's lined and heavy. way too long. just didn't wow me. the lace is sturdy and beautiful, though.",4,20/05/2018
Love this top,"I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined, so no need to wear a cami underneath.",5,09/05/2018
If you're short...this is long!,"I'm only 4'11"" and this top comes to the top of my knees. i could wear it as a mini-dress. lol! so, it is definitely a tunic for us shorter gals. now, it can be shortened. the underlayer can be cut and rehemmed shorter. then the over-lay lace has to be very gently snipped around the scallop pattern a few rows up. i'm debating whether i should do it or not. the bottom is simply a snipped off row from the fabric to create the scallop lace trim anyway.

as far as sizing, it's tailored. i didn't f",5,01/03/2018
Not my thing...,"This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric, especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however, the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition, the bow seemed to be too t",2,20/07/2018
So-so,"I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable, on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be",3,10/04/2018
Sweet,"I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect, which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought, but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!",5,04/12/2018
It's okay,"Ahhh, i should have listened to previous reviews. indeed, this top runs very large. style wise, it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer.",3,04/09/2018
Nice,"Darling top, lovely dark rich raspberry red color. runs very large so definitely size down. i ordered the s and m. i am usually m but went with the small. the s was smaller in the shoulders of course but not terribly- it was only an issue when i hugged myself. in the picture it looks like it fits her very well. i don't feel like it fits me quite as well- it's borderline maternity-ish... just a little too large and should come in at the waist just a touch more. i agree the bow i.e. seems weak (fa",4,17/07/2018
Disappointed,I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.,3,08/05/2018
Petite on this one (5 foot one and a half lol),"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.

color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,.",5,14/05/2018
Cute blouse,"Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however, i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips, smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still, i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c), but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.",3,19/08/2018
Lovely,"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do.",5,11/06/2018
Pretty- soft fabric and nice color.,I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.,5,14/03/2018
Strange shirt,"This shirt was strange. the bow tie was too thin and the dots were too dominant on the shirt. it looks okay in the model picture, but when i tried it on the bow and the dots just clashed.",3,23/10/2018
Cute top,I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece in stock at my local store. it's a very comfortable top with plenty of room. the only criticism i have regarding it is that it's a bit maternity-esque. bought it in an xs.,4,27/09/2018
Goes with everything!,"I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!",5,16/02/2018
Great summer top,This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.,5,10/03/2018
Awful,"I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.",1,14/10/2018
Very itchy,"I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.
wouldn't recommend it.",1,30/04/2018
Poor quality,The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,1,03/06/2018
Just what my closet needed,A sweet tunic with the distinctive lace hemline. the length is great - just right to wear with skinny jeans or over leggings. not too long but long enough for comfort over leggings! more of a boxy fit (just as expected). wore it with my skinny jeans and short boots and got many compliments.,4,10/11/2018
Be careful of sizing,"This top is beautiful aesthetically, and i liked the tunic length. the bottom lace is cut out, so make sure things are adequately covered if you wear this with leggings. the fit is flattering.

however, i had some issues with the sizing. i usually wear an xs or a s in tops. the body of both sizes yielded a boxy fit for me, which is seen on the model.. i tried the top with a belt, which looked nice. however, the thing that stopped me from keeping the top was the shoulder/armpit/sleeve area. the s",3,15/07/2018
Favorite royal blue feminine top,"I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of",5,08/06/2018
Better in person...,"I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase. fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe. it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect. can be dressed up or down as you like it. does run a bit large but it's due to the style, not the sizing. i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it. go ahead-press the button!",5,12/05/2018
Lovely top,"Purchased in white. very pretty top. i thought it would be more lace - but non the less, it is lovely.",4,16/04/2018
Fabric not comfortable,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.,3,14/06/2018
Very cute top,"I really liked the top once i saw it, but it needs to be worn with a cami underneath. the fabric is a little stiff. it runs true to size and it fits like a peplum top with extra space around the waist. the top is not really crocheted by hand it was done by machine, but it is a nice top.",3,15/02/2018
Beautiful blouse,"I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.",5,02/03/2018
Another great retailer top!,"Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)",5,04/05/2018
Gorgeous versatile velvet top,"I love this top-it fits true to size, hits at the low hip so its not too short, and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans, freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots, and a glittery silver necklace, but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt, tights and boots, and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm",5,04/06/2018
Gorgeous!,Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.,5,18/09/2018
Timeless black velvet top,"This is a classic, well made, velvet top. it fits true to size, is very flattering ,the on- line photos don't do it justice. very pretty in real life. 34a 123 lbs ordered the xs.",5,28/11/2018
Lovely and comfortable,"I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt, there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable, and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul",4,16/06/2018
Sleek and chic!,"I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print, wearability from day to night, comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!",5,21/07/2018
Stunning blouse,"Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse, but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture, and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion, but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun, cute detail, and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.",5,24/02/2018
Super cute peasant top,"This is a super cute peasant top. super light weight and perfect for summer, looks good with jeans or shorts, perfect for summer, spring, or fall. colors are super pretty and bright.",5,27/02/2018
Frayed bottom hem.....,"This top is super cute, however the bottom hem is all frayed....couldn't really tell that from the pictures. the ""flutter"" sleeves are too big...looks funny with the fraying...runs a little large as well. loved the color! perfect with white denim!",3,19/06/2018
Cute top,"I ordered this top because it was 100 percent cotton and a cute design. when it arrived, i thought it was a cute, different top, uniquely designed. when i tried it on, it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering. it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice. unfortunately, it did not work for me. i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect",2,04/09/2018
Stain on shirt,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,1,22/07/2018
Beautiful blouse,"I love this blouse, it's very unique and gorgeous. this blouse is versatile with short, jean and skirt. love it!!!",5,05/11/2018
Unique design,"Loved this blouse when i received it after ordering online! the cut and style of the blouse is so cute and looks great with jeans. it is well made but it is see-through so i had to wear something under it. otherwise, really flattering, unique design!",4,09/02/2018
Dainty & pretty plaid,"Very cute plaid button down that is tts; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts. the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels--which this is not. it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath, it is not a flannel shirt. colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive. happy i got this on sale & sale",4,15/05/2018
Perfect for summer,Sheer and lightweight. perfect for summer. great detail could not justify paying full price.,3,29/10/2018
"Really cute, with a great fit","This top is super cute, nice and light for the hot weather, with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra, so it shows through. but, with a black bra, there is no problem.",5,25/05/2018
Perfect summer top,"Light weight and cotton, great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me, but they are not falling down so far. also, if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black, you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer.",5,02/05/2018
Only for smaller types,I agree with the other reviewer the concept of this is fantastic. but sadly did not work for me. first of all it runs so small i normally wear a 6/8 and ordered a 10 and i still had a hard time closing over my 34ddd chest. but i am abnormal. anyways the peplum i wish was a little more subdued like in the photo. maybe its because im so curvy but it just didn't work for me. sadly its going back.,4,21/09/2018
Nice concept,"Conceptually, this top is great. love the design and the bright crisp color and most of all the cut outs. the material is a little stiff but can see it softening up a bit with a wash or two. it does run very small. i am 145 pounds, 5'6: with a full 34c bust and a curvy hourglass figure 34, 28, 41. while it fits everywhere else, the bust is really small. i wear a size 6 but had to go up to a size 10. the size 8 fit but the chest would only close without a bra. so, i had to go up 2 sizes.. so when",4,04/04/2018
Runs small,"Adorable top, but it runs very small. i usually take a 4, but thought it may shrink up so i ordered a 6. it was a bit tight through the bust (34a), so i sent it back for an 8.",4,14/02/2018

Perfect top,"I was in love with this top as soon as i saw it. i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together. i've worn it once (the day i got it, i was so excited) and washed it and it is still in great shape.
i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in, as it was a little longer than i'm used to. but nothing too long. my torso is short.
the material is not thick or heavy. and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin. nice material, but not something to wear if it's very ch",5,09/04/2018
Just love...,"I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl",5,26/07/2018
Lovely romantic blouse,"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!",5,01/04/2018
Lovely,This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!,5,21/08/2018
Still love it even if...,"...there's enough room for a small family to live under the chest and trunk area of the blouse! sorry-had to say that! all kidding aside-since it's been thirty plus years ago since we were wearing these, many of us have forgotten what peasant blouses truly fit like. this is no exception- it is very billowy, flouncy, and roomy-more so even than today's peasant styles, i think. it is lovely and quite fitted across the chest -so that's how i ordered my size and it worked. i think if one sizes down",4,04/03/2018
Lovely,A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,5,26/05/2018
Sleeves are really small,This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.,3,09/09/2018
Beautiful blouse but....,"Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.

oh well, it's going back!",3,21/06/2018
Love this shirt,"This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.",5,28/02/2018
Not doing anything for me,"Well, this top just did not do anything for me - it's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit. you'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through. i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event, but it was too buttoned-up for my style. i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me. i didn't care for the feel of the fabric either, although the lace is nice.",3,03/09/2018
My favorite black top.,"This is a timeless top. i loved the overall look of the top and after eyeing it for several days decided to purchase it. warning, the shoulder area is cut small due to the fabric at the top. i am usually a size 12 (because of ddd chest) but i bumped up to a 14 and it was perfect.",4,26/05/2018
Super flattering,Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.,5,30/09/2018
"Beautiful, but a few caveats","This is as beautiful in person as online, but the length is shorter than the description, and the arms are tight! although i am 5'1"", i normally wear regular sizes in retailer just fine; however, the 28"" length scared me off, so i ordered a 2p. it says it's 26.25"" long, but it's actually just about 24"". and my normal sized arms struggled to fit into the sleeves - yikes! but it's gorgeous and was purchased with a gift card, so i will keep :-)",4,18/10/2018
Not as pretty in person,"I was excited to see this top in person, but once i got a close up look at it (and also tried it on) i was disappointed. first, the color is much more persimmon orangey in person and that's a hard color to pull off for a lot of people. it just pulls any pink or red in your skin and highlights it. 

second, the top was poorly finished. i had to pick up two to try on because the lace was wonky across the front of the first one i grabbed. so much so that the lace was puckered because it had been",3,18/07/2018
Feminine and tts,"Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1"" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for",5,10/07/2018

Pretty top,"I fell in love with this top when i tried it on at the store. it's a great fall piece. it is see-through around the bust, so a nude bra or any color camisole would have to be worn. my only thing is that it seems a little dressy, so i'm wondering how much i'll wear it. i work from home so everything has to be somewhat casual. so, i do recommend it, but i'm undecided as to if i'm going to keep it. for reference, i'm a 34d with a thin upper body and took a size medium.",4,28/09/2018
Pretty and feminine,"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami. 
my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin",5,21/06/2018

"Super cute and flow, perfect for summer","I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!",5,04/06/2018
Pretty but sheer,"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.",5,10/08/2018
A size 2 too big,"I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very, very rarely a size 0, so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose, flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however, the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.

i do really like the styling and quality, so i am planning on",3,29/11/2018
Super cute,I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,5,09/03/2018
Great top,This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.,5,10/10/2018
Sold out,"I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.",5,11/10/2018
Gorgeous blouse; runs small,"I'm a size xl, so my review might not apply to all people. i purchase my retailer tops in size xl and sometimes they fit great and sometimes they don't. when i put this top on it looked like i was wearing an open cardigan; nowhere near buttoning. i have some sewing experience, so i removed all 4 box pleats which gave me an additional 8 inches of fabric. after doing this i was able to easily button up the blouse and have it lay nicely. but i literally needed that extra 8 inches of fabric in the mid",4,22/06/2018
Beautiful but....,"......not for the long waisted. i immediately ordered this top when i saw it online. the embroidery is beuatiful (although it will require extra care). the soft lavendar color was a breathe of fresh air. however, i felt like i was wearing a maternity top as it hung oddly on my slim, 5'9"" frame. i am long waisted so perhaps petites will find this top works for them. i agree with the other reviewer that indicated the arm openings are a bit large and deep. sadly, this one went back....",3,11/07/2018
Wait for sale...,"Tried in store today and found to fit tts. images are accurate in terms of color and showing that there is a tiny bit of sheerness to this (as you can see near the bottom in each photo). i really loved everything about it except that it flared out a bit on the bottom in a way that i'd probably fuss with too much. id probably buy it on sale, but not before that.",4,14/05/2018
Beautiful embroidered purple tank,"I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer, it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online, it would",5,21/08/2018
Too wide,"The detail on this top is beautiful, love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad, but it is much too wide, bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is, another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides, because the top does not lay like that. it runs large, especially under the arms. too bad......",3,21/03/2018
Based on trying on one size larger,"I tried on a small, but usually am xs:

this shirt dind't seem like it had too much fabric or too bulky to me as it did to others adn i tried on a larger size. teh material is soft and feminine, and love the embroidered detail. one thing to note is i found that even with the layer of fabric, it was still a bit sheer and i could see through in some of the dressing room lighting. didn't purchase only based on the skin tone v's shirt color. color of shirt is gorgeous, but i am pale and it wasn't",4,07/02/2018
Very wide,"The color and detailing on this shirt are pretty, but it is incredibly wide at the hips. as someone with a large chest, it was very unflattering.",3,17/02/2018
Meh,"I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful, the embroidery is well done, the fabric is soft, and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath, but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.",3,01/03/2018
Cute top,I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.,5,13/04/2018
Unique and eye-catching top,I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.,5,12/06/2018
Billowy waist,"Pretty color, great details, awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck, arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.",3,17/03/2018
Beautiful but lots of material,This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.,3,28/03/2018
This is a fun top!,"For myself it brings out the playful side of me. it is flows and just looks lovely. i wore it with a white denim skirt, and booties. i know white, and it looked great. the fabric is beautiful, and in the sun it is breathtaking",5,03/02/2018
Stiff fabric,"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",1,20/08/2018
Soft and pretty,"Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.",5,25/03/2018
Nice fit,This blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering.,4,09/05/2018
Just beautiful,This top is delicate and so feminine. it is beautiful. does run small. i had to size up. i'm usually a 6-8 m and had to buy l. it has no stretch.  so i needed room for movement.,5,25/05/2018
"Must have, elegant, chic","This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy, however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too ""blousy."" highly recommend this-",5,06/12/2018
It's not a black and white top - it's ecru and bla,"I suppose i would have kept this top i hadn't been misled about the color. i don't like ecru or eggshell--
the description said it was black and white.",3,26/08/2018
Very cute but harder to wear than i expected,"This top is so cute and i immediately had to purchase it when i saw it. i am usually drawn to boxy, cropped shirts, but i find this is harder to wear than i anticipated. it may be because i got a small size, but it is boxier than i anticipated and is almost hard to wear with even jeans. i recommend you buy because the detailing is so pretty and perfect, but try on and make sure you have some good bottoms to pair it with!",4,10/02/2018
Unique style and embroidery,"This top fits loosely through the body and a little snigger in the bust. fabric is nice but does require some ironing/steaming at times. it is a little pricey but you won't find anything similar so being unique makes it worth the cost. i ordered online but it was available at my local retailer store; unfortunately the online order didn't show availability & i would have liked to see it first since i was unsure of size ( usually wear medium if top has a relaxed fit, large if not). very cute too!",4,05/05/2018
Fun and whimsical top,"This is such a great top for spring and summer. i've worn it with shorts, capris, and jeans, as well as layered it under a denim jacket. it brings an element of whimsy to any outfit. it's comfortable and really well made.",5,17/09/2018
Gorgeous but falls apart,"This top is a lot more striking in person. on, it's quite stunning. it is a tad short but that's part of the aesthetic and i don't find it unflattering. however, the first time i wore it one of the black rope/thread details disintegrated and fell apart. i tried to reinforce the end and reattach it but it just came apart again. i understand the nature of the top makes it more delicate, but this was definitely disappointing. i mentioned it when i went back into the store and the sales girl sympath",4,10/05/2018
Folklorica happy!,"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos",5,03/05/2018
Work of art,"This is an extraordinary blouse and it is the poster child of retailer. the embroidery looks beautiful online but i appreciate it much more in person. the details are breathtaking, especially the scalloped borders around the arm holes, neck, and hem lines. i grew up around embroidery art and this is very high quality work, not even one stitch out of place and no hanging loose threads either. i like the black thread on cream because it's classy and it displays the details. the blouse materia",4,08/09/2018
"Strange, unflattering fit","This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5""4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",2,27/11/2018
More beautiful in person,I bought this in the store and love it. seeing it online - i would never think to buy it. much more flattering in person!,4,28/09/2018
Fun summer top,Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture,5,20/03/2018
Beautiful tank to wear for years,"I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering, though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr, tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30",5,30/06/2018
"Beautiful, huge armholes","The design is stunning, the color is universally super-flattering. it's a lovely top. so much so that i tried it on even though it was pricey. but the armholes are huge. you can see it on the model, who is definitely not wearing a bra. on me, there was a lot of side bra exposure. if they'd had smaller sizes at the berkeley store, i would've given them a shot, but my true size was a really poor fit.",4,01/05/2018
Bright but boxy,"There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top. that being said, the cotton is substantive and crisp, the embroidery striking, the coral color bright and summery. it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden, which i honestly kind of hate, but the top is so lovely no one's going to be assessing your hips. if you have narrow hips and perky breasts, though, what a perfect summer top (although, i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect!)",5,18/04/2018
"Gorgeous top, with the right bra (or lack thereof)","This top is so pretty, even better in person. it's made really well and i love that it's washable. i did have some initial reservations with the fit. i'm petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra 'help'. but with the way this top is cut, swingy and slightly bell shaped, i found that wearing a bra, even one with light foam cups (not even pushup), was making the shape of the top look really weird. once i took off the bra, the top actually looked great. i got",5,24/02/2018
My newest go to,"I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,",5,30/03/2018
Beautiful but wide,"I see other reviewers are like me. we are wondering why antho has so many waistless, big, flowy tops! please! more tops with a defined waist! please!
i love this top. it's a gorgeous color and a lot of work to it, very retro antho, not just a t-shirt like so many are these days. to my delight, it runs large. i usually wear a 14 or 16, but the store had a 12 in the sale room, and not only did it fit, but i plan to have my seamstress taper the waistline and cut off the ""wings"" that flare off on t",4,12/10/2018
Stunning,This is a very flattering blouse. gorgeous detail with the beading!,5,30/03/2018
Not worth the price,I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on,3,03/12/2018
Dressing inspiration,"I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts, leggings, trousers, jeans...with a vest, jacket, or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy, it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule",5,11/09/2018
Great top!,This is a very stylish casual top. it fits great! i plan on wearing it with a long sleeve black tshirt underneath or black turtleneck. i absolutely love the crochet detail at the bottom!,4,24/04/2018
Lovely top,"I'm 5'1"" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is.",3,09/08/2018
Disappointing,"I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen, in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover, the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.
overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",2,13/11/2018
Beautiful embroidery,"My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer, but it was much, much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer, i jumped on it. she loves it.",5,21/04/2018
Love the colorful embroidery,"A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.",5,02/10/2018
Nice,"I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available, so can't compare there.

color: i liked the black better for these reasons:
1) color can be worn year-round, just add a nice jacket or cardigan, and ok for winter season.
2) ivory was kind of see-through

size: xxs fit me better, the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.

sadly, the xxs was the ivory, so i didn't keep either of them.

Showstopper,"I added this to a stack of try-ons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on. 148 dollars is a little pricey but didn't hesitate it was so beautiful, i am a 32b and normally wear a size 6 and the small fit perfectly. can't wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks!",5,09/05/2018
So pretty!,"I wanted to get a couple tops for date nights that went well with skinny jeans and this hit the mark! as mentioned before, this top is translucent and thus would recommend using a cami as well. however the embroidery is beautiful. i have not had it cleaned yet and thus cannot comment on the durability. can't wait to wear it out.",4,21/09/2018
Simply pretty,This shirt is simply pretty. it's light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans.,5,07/02/2018
Beautiful wispy flowers,"This beautiful blouse first caught my eye in the store. i thought it was a bit pricey, but couldn't keep thinking about it. walked away without it! then i went online and it had gone on sale! i knew i had to have it. the large fit perfectly! i got so many compliments on the blouse. i wore it with skinny jeans and little boots! i couldn't be happier with this gorgeous blouse!",5,01/09/2018
Gorgeous,"This is a truly exquisite top. it looks exactly as it does online with cascades of delicately embroidered flowers on front and back and a slightly ruffled neck. very chic and versatile with skirts or pants.
material is very light and chiffon like and it's fully lined so no need for a cami. it's ever so slightly see-through in the sections that are not embroidered but only in very intense light.

Beautiful top!,"For sizing, i normally wear either xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i tried on both, and both fit, but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs. i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable. when i tried on the ivory color, i could see my blue bra underneath, and it would require a cami. the black didn't. i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck. i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button, but it's not a deterrent.",5,23/07/2018
"So-so, for the price","Pretty tank, embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price, should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.",3,14/11/2018
I love this shirt,Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.,5,28/04/2018

Beautiful blouse; unfinished threads to sew,"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g",5,11/09/2018
O.m.g. soooo beautiful,"I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just ""knew"". when i finally got home and tried it on, it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck, coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then, you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.",5,30/11/2018
Not like the picture,The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,1,22/01/2018

Itchy,"Very pretty top, but like the other reviewers said?the neck is very itchy. i live in florida and i don't think i can wear this during the summer unless i get the neck lined. i got an xxs p which was a little shorter than i would have liked, so i am returning for xxs.",4,19/09/2018
Love this top!,"This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it, is the three buttons in the back at the top are very, very difficult to button.",5,17/07/2018
A beautiful work of art!,"The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size, figure flattering, and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece, this is it!",5,24/01/2018

"Adorable, runs large","This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.",5,19/11/2018
"Looks good in person, shrunk a lot","I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but, once i washed it (in cold in my machine, reshaped and air-dried), it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.",4,05/02/2018

"Pretty, but...","When i first saw this top online, i thought it is very common beach like cover up, give or take. the main point of attraction for me was the cobalt blue silk trim. very vibrant looking color and very attractive. cough my eye for sure. however, when it arrived i was really surprised, how the top turned out to be. 1. much larger than expected, very roomy. 2. cobalt blue turned out to be not so bright, in fact, not even that interesting as it stands out in the photo. not too bad, but unexpected, i",4,28/08/2018
Not for a 34g,"This tank is lovely: understated but well-made of nice fabric. i love viscose because it drapes nicely on my curves. but this is a swing shaped tank. shoulda known better. and it's cropped so... giant fabric tent hanging from the biggest part of me. if i put in big french darts, it'd be too too short. no way to make it work so it's going back.

Extremely delicate top,"I so wanted to buy this top - especially during the 30% off tops sale this past weekend - so it would have been just about $100.  but while it was well made, i could see it easily snagging or getting caught on jewelry.    if it was on sale even more, i might have considered it.  it could be extremely versatile, with jeans, black skinny pants or leggings.  really loved it, but couldn't see spending that much money on it.",4,22/09/2018
I like it enough,"But runs large. i tried on the regular 0 in the store and it was very pretty but baggy. would definitely need a tank if i were to wear this to work. lace is romantic and i do like the button details. i would give it a try but for me i will take my chance and wait for sale if it makes it there in my sie. i need 00. petite already gone sadly.

Lovelove!,"Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium, and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo, which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.",5,15/05/2018
Still not sure about this,"After seeing the picture online, i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it, but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big, but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to",3,17/07/2018
Very large; lace is kinda coarse,"Thought i'd love this top; i'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer.  but i found the lace, while pretty, to be quite rough, which to me indicates a lower quality. and i guess i should've known that it would be very swingy (photos show that) but it really overwhelmed me.  for reference, 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34d. sad, but this went back.",3,01/09/2018

What went wrong?,"I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!",1,14/04/2018
Flowy & feminine,Beautiful and flowy blouse . bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down - 1 size. very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern. i am a 36c on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties.,5,17/07/2018
Beautiful top!,"I have to disagree with earlier reviewers who suggested this top isn't flattering for larger-breasted women. i'm breastfeeding, so i currently have dds that are the bane of my existence, and i was very happy with the way this top fit across my chest. i didn't give it a full 5 stars for aesthetic/design only because i wish it were a bit longer. it hit me below my waist, but not below the crotch of my jeans where it hits the model (possibly because she is not burdened by swollen breasts). the shir",4,17/02/2018
Love!!!,"I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,",5,20/05/2018
Cute in pic but...,"Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps",2,13/08/2018
Dissapointed,"This is a beautiful top, however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.",3,21/04/2018
Unexpectedly had to have it,"I love this top and despite the higher price point, it came home with me. normally i tend to go for very basic colors - white, black, gray. but i saw this and was intrigued by the high neck and subtle cut away sleeveless style. tried it on and it was love. the fit is great. it is flowey, but without the maternity look in front and all that extra fabric in the back. it's just right. i love the print and i am so not a print person. i tried it on with some taupe skinny jeans and a denim jacket. per",4,14/11/2018
Nice!,"Very old color and item. a little full, but comfortable.",5,03/11/2018
Took a chance,"Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big, boxy, and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0",3,26/02/2018
Too wide,I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.,2,09/04/2018
"Love the color, but not the fit","I wish this fit more to the body, it really does flare out a lot,a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful, so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.
fabric is light for summer, so if you are thin, not muscular, perhaps that would look great?",3,31/01/2018
"Pretty, but unlined!","I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath.",4,25/10/2018
"Fresh fit, great colors","I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh.",5,07/03/2018
Beautiful!,"This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!",5,23/08/2018
Pretty but,"Ok, received this in the mail yesterday and tried on this morning, i ordered the size 2 snd it is really big. i notice that the armhole sag and there is a lot of extra room everywhere. i am a 32d on the top so that is why i ordered the size 2, but i will return this and order the size 0 and i hope that will take care of the sagging arm area",4,08/03/2018
Can't believe this top hasn't sold out yet,"I bought this top in 2 colors. it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear, so i bought it in the 3rd color. it's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel, weekends, and work. the feel of the fabric is gorgeous, but it pills after wear. so when the top went on sale, i bought an extra set of all 3 colors. now i have a set for play and a set for work. i love this shirt.",4,14/10/2018
Fits like a tent,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,2,27/05/2018
Love love love!,"I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don",5,17/08/2018
"Great, feminine blouse",I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-),5,15/09/2018
Too large and not flattering,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,2,01/05/2018
Beautiful colors. comfy. swingy,Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.,5,08/09/2018
"Beautiful, but flawed","I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk, the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great, however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less, the fabulous swing shape would work. that said, i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house, if sale was on sale again.",4,25/03/2018
Size down!,"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",2,28/09/2018
Massive!,"I get that it's a swing tank, and it's supposed to be loose but i got a 00p and it's huge! too much material. with that being said, it's such a cute top that i decided to keep it. i got it taken in about 2 inches on each side and it now looks great.",4,20/11/2018
Fine workmanship and fresh swing shape,"I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w",5,30/05/2018
Love this shirt!,This shirt is a steal at the sale price. i've received many compliments. it is a swing top- so not a lot of form. i wear a cami underneath & have found the style to be comfortable for work.,5,19/07/2018
Sweet top,This a beatifully made top - it does run large so i sized down. it has a very floaty quality but it truly lovely so i kept it and glad i did - i've had many compliments! have run a ribbon through the holes around the waist once to pull it in and it worked really well - it's convertible!,4,08/02/2018
Pretty top,I like that the top is lightweight and very comfortable and is flattering. i can see wearing this over the holidays for entertaining. it looks festive and pretty - something easy to pop on and look pulled together in a flash.,4,26/03/2018
Not flattering on anyone,"Disappointed, the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.",2,11/05/2018
Amazing go to white blouse,"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!

the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing.",5,28/10/2018
So cute!,"I am in love with this top. it is so feminine and cute. i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty!! i got the cream color. i wish there were more solid colors. i usually wear a medium, which is what i ordered, and i love how it fits. i like flowy tops so it is perfect. please make solid colors!!!",5,29/03/2018
So silky soft and lightweight,Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love! i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments. the shirt is light and flowy. it very flattering for any body shape.,5,22/06/2018
"Very nice, just as pictured","Very cute top, just as pictured, nice soft material, color is bright and true to size. wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments. highly recommend!",5,09/04/2018
"Xl fits great, color description is a bit off","I ordered the purple in size xl. the fit on me matches the model so i think it's true to size. i wouldn't say there's much purple to this print. i can't really find any. the areas where the blue/red overlap just look navy. the photos show how it really looks. it's a great mix of light brown, peach, white, red and different shades of blue. there will be variations because of pattern placement. i love this style--it's very comfortable.",5,13/08/2018
"Flirty, frilly and fun.","I love wearing this blouse with jeans and my cute sneakers. this blouse is frilly and flirty. it has three quarter sleeves that have one cute fabric covered buttons that match the button front closure. i am 5ft 1 inch, pear shaped, and my bust line is 36 c. i ordered an xs and small regular. i ended up with the small regular, and it fits nicely and i get loads of compliments when i wear it. it's made very well and the plaid pattern is random. i wear a cute boxy sweater over it when its chilly, a",5,06/03/2018
Boxy - odd fit. bodice not as fitted as shown,After reading so many great reviews i was sure i was going to love it but i'm so glad i tried it on in the print at the store. the small was baggy in the bust - ti was not slightly fitted as shown in the picture. the extra small was to small in the chest and the seam came up too high. it was also very low cut. the shirt as shown has to be pinned behind the models back because there's no way it would look like that otherwise. if it would have been a little more tailored as shown in the photo i wo,3,26/08/2018
Pretty design but poor quality,"Pretty design, but when i tried it on, the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier, it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.",2,20/09/2018
Loved the colors!,"I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. i am 5'6"" and 107lbs., 32d. the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs.",5,02/05/2018
Nice flow top,"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!",5,27/04/2018
Light and comfy,"Fun, flowy top! maybe be a little snug across the top for larger chested girls but this flares out into a light and airy dream to wear!",5,06/05/2018
Nice top,I purchased my normal size small. i loved the colors in the purple which are more blue and vibrant red to me. this top is a nice soft fabric. it will pair nice with denim jeans.,5,18/08/2018
Great top-but quality an issue,"I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat, the fabric is light and breathes. however, pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.",2,10/02/2018
Lovely,I bought this in black and the checkered pattern. love both. very floaty and feminine. fits true to size.,5,30/05/2018
Runs very large,"This top is really cute, but it runs very large. i am 5'2 100 lbs and the xs petite looked like it was 3 sizes too big on. the design is really cute, but recommend ordering down at least one size.",4,26/01/2018
Spring blouse,"This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.",5,25/11/2018
Size 16 looks great,"I bought the navy/ivory patterned one in size 16. i loved the details of the faces so much that i ordered a second one in the same pattern on sale. now, i see they're still available on clearance so i have a 3rd (the ivory with pastel stripes). the length is perfect. it's comfortable, washes well, and has personality. i love these. i should have bought the other whimsical prints. i've had good use out of them this summer and will in the colder months too.",5,08/09/2018
Love it!,This is a great top. runs tts. looks great with cropped skinny jeans and booties or wedges in the spring.,5,06/03/2018

Love this top,"Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it, glad i purchased it.",5,24/05/2018
A new favorite,"Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not, busy but just enough so, and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.",5,31/10/2018
Love!,"I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on, the perfect length, beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb and the s was for me.",5,19/11/2018

Great blouse!,"This blouse is not only flattering, but a great way to dress up a pair of jeans! fits well, but a big tight around the arms, had to go up a size.",4,18/03/2018
Versitile classic,"I usually do not like three quarter sleeve shirts and i do not like tie necks of any sorts. this blouse has both and i love it! i loved it in pictures and, against my two dislikes listed above, i gave it a chance. i am glad i did. the shirt is lined in the body which means the white one is not see through...yey, no need for cami underneath! the lining also adds extra warmth as this is a very thin fabric shirt. the sleeves are loose enough so that the 3/4 length does not restrict me. the tie some",5,03/09/2018
"Simple, classic top","For the sale price, this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because, being on sale, that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders, and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later, i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers, but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true",5,28/10/2018
Cute,"This top has a flattering shape. the neckline is low, but not too low for work, and it flares a bit at the bottom. my only complaint is that it is short. i have a longish torso and this shirt hits right at the top of my pant's waistline. i just prefer tops to be a bit longer, but it's still a cute top.",4,25/01/2018
Great find!,"This top is adorable on. the online picture doesn't do it justice. a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on. i got it in xs - black. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. it has the perfect drape to it. it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little. this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months. love it.",5,01/09/2018

Nice and feminine flowy top,"This top is not bmeant to be super fitted, it is flowy and ""romantic"". i have ordered the petite to decide which size to keep, but my usual xs was fine, wil ljsut compare length. i was also curious about hte smaller size, but didn't order it, so i wil lnever know.

"So comfortable, flattering & with a great print","I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model. this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases. the cut is very flattering. i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top, the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out. i'm a pear-shape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips, but it all flows really nicely. the arms aren't tight. they're not loose but aren't too poofy.

Great top for pregnant women:),I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,5,30/09/2018
Pretty in blue,This top is beautiful in color and fabric. unfortunately just didn't work in the breast line. gapped and there was just nothing i could do to make it hang correctly. i'm not really large in the chest area (38b) but the large just didn't work. had to send it back.,3,26/04/2018

Colorful dots,"The tunic shown here (black and white) is the style i purchased, but not the color scheme. the one i got has a navy background with colorful large dots. the top is very cute, but has one drawback. it has covered buttons all the way down...and the top area gaps a bit so you can see your bra. i remedied the situation by sewing down the area on the placket around the top two buttons. worked like a charm! my new favorite top.",4,18/10/2018

Amazing!,"I love this tunic, super flattering + long enough (if your no super tall like me) to wear with leggings! it does run a little big, i like tops a little looser on me so i didn't mind that. i ordered a small- if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down. 

i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!

"Calia tunic, yes and no","I bought the calia tunic in blk/wht and in red motif. i love the black and white one. the cut is flattering and stylish. comfortable. you can dress it up or down. all good. 
the red motif is cut differently. the neckline is very low. the shape is different from the black and white one. i am not sure why but i returned it.
neither shirt is as long as the one pictured on the model. i would recommend the black and white one though.",4,30/06/2018
Great shirt!!,Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.,5,21/05/2018
Confortable,"This top is so nice i bought it in 2 colors. washes well but does need to be ironed. 
fits true to size.",5,16/09/2018
This is a great blouse,"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5,20/02/2018
"Excellent, comfortable, dressy or casual","I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.

i only wish this came in solid white (o",5,24/10/2018
Beige blah,"The fit was fine, but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted, i'm fair skinned, but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.",3,11/08/2018
Very cute shirt,This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.,5,16/03/2018
Love this blouse!,This is a comfortable pretty blouse. i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it.,5,01/05/2018
Love love love,I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!,5,30/09/2018
The perfect top,"This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it's slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!",5,14/10/2018
Sweet!,"I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.",5,06/12/2018
Great tunic,I love this! i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully. it's comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe. it's a staple piece that i know i'll be able to use for years.,5,01/10/2018
Perfect for work and going out!,"Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down, so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!",5,13/06/2018
Perfect all occasion top,"Absolutely love! wear it with suits, jeans...anything. the orange color is super unique and the lace is so pretty and seems like it will hold up over time. so glad i purchased!!!!",4,25/06/2018
Maeve delivers again!,"Like all maeve tops of this nature, i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue, the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!), and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops, but i do not have one in a color like this",5,12/06/2018
"Orange color was pretty, poor quality fabric",I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,1,04/12/2018
Cute top,I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.,5,07/05/2018
Lovely top,"This top is lovely and flowy! it fits true to size, and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out. i felt like it was a little sheer, but it wasn't problematic enough for me to take away a star :-)",5,09/04/2018
Beautiful and feminine,"I bought this blouse in two different colors -- the orange and ivory -- and kept the orange. the style and fit were very flattering. the drape of the fabric, along with length (hitting right below waist) and sleeves are very flattering. i am 5'4'' and 118lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. i have muscular arms and the capped sleeves are perfect. i returned the ivory due to the sheerness of the fabric. it is quite sheer, which is a problem if i wanted to wear this for work. also, you can see the dark",4,07/09/2018
Very pretty,"This top is very pretty. it's a bit more voluminous than the picture would let on, but otherwise as expected. you can adjust the ties at the shoulder.",4,23/07/2018
Different than pictured,"I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size",2,04/11/2018
Perfect button down,"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed, and the size 0 fits just right.",5,07/02/2018
Darling,"I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall.",5,16/05/2018
Maybe i have a long torso,"I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style, the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.",3,10/06/2018
Fun work shirt,I wear a lot of solid dark colors for work so i liked this was dark blue but had more pop than the basic navy. able to pay it up with other colors too. the sides are a little shorter so have to watch throughout the day so belly isn't showing. not a bid deal overall.,4,13/05/2018
Nice blouse,"Got this on sale, in three colors! love the look of the blouses, great for work. only con is that the sides are shorter than i would like.",4,12/09/2018
Lovely fabric,Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.,5,04/04/2018
"Great button down, runs small","I purchased this in the red & love the fabric and overall design of the top. i have returned it for a larger size. it is very small through the chest. hopefully, a larger size will give me more room though the chest without being too large in the rest of the shirt. i'm a 34 c and ordered a size 6 for reference.",4,28/09/2018
Black and white is navy?,"I love this top and find it flattering, but the black and white polka-dotted motif that i purchased definitely has navy blue in it -- not black. kind of disappointing that the color description was so inaccurate.",4,04/05/2018
Very comfortable and cute,"This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.",5,13/10/2018
Great piece!,"I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently, i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants, and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side, but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however, if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6"", i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;)
overall, this is a great addition to your wardrobe, and it washes nicel",5,31/01/2018
00 petite is way too short on the sides,"I ordered the black & white, 00 petite. i'm 5' 2"", 96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back, from neckline) which is great for me; however, the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25"", so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00, regular length, but then the sleeves will b",2,22/04/2018
So soft! and blue-er in person,"I wasnt expecting this top to be so soft and comfortable and breezy! i am usually an xs petite, but based on reviews i got the regular small. it is a little loose, but the length is perfect. i am short for reference (5'2, 107 lb, 32c). the buttons gaped a very tiny bit, like a centimeter, but not to the point where any skin or bra was visible. had i got the xsp, i think the gaping would have been an issue. the arms are too baggy for my taste (length is ok though), but i fold the sleeves up at th",4,28/11/2018
Love it,Great top. i got the size 4 but i ordered a 6 and plan to return the 4 depending on how the 6 fits. the top is really cute but it fits just right and i would like a little more room. when i raise my hands the entire shirt raises up. otherwise cannot wait to wear it and this is a great purchase.,4,03/02/2018
Gorgeous red shirt!!,"I love this shirt so much i bought it (nearly) full price with my birthday month discount!
get it! i purchased the red and also like the black/white polka dots - hangs beautifully,
feels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time. i bought the medium am generally
a medium.",5,22/07/2018
Beautiful and comfortable!,"I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture, which makes it more interesting.",5,17/02/2018
So chic!,"This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were ""it's a standout"". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!",5,14/02/2018
Definitely not my best look,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on, the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami, which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described), but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel",3,31/07/2018
Cute country tunic,"I just got this shirt the other day at the store.
to my surprise i needed a size zero. i usually wear a size 4 or small never that small. 
i am 5'4 and a 34dd and it was still a little loose!! i bought the blue and brown color combination.
it looked really cute on with a pair of white jeans for summer.",4,29/01/2018
Weekend cuteness!,"I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded, worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!
the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build, small bust. true to size.",5,03/08/2018
"So cute, honey is surprisingly classy","I so wanted this top in red, and tried on the 0, but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5"" frame #115 lbs, 30dd#, i tried ordering 0petite, but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color, so i decided to try it, even though i am very pale... well, i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red, but it is super flattering, and the color is actually classy,... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit, not just casual. i love the feel, the fabric is airy, great",5,12/10/2018
Great top,"This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size.",5,18/11/2018
Love at first sight!,This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for!,5,31/01/2018
"Cute top, flatters large bust","I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an",5,12/03/2018
Great shirt,"This shirt is a great deal on sale,i would not pay full price.i got it in the honey color and it is really cute. this shirt does run very large. i normally wear a small or size 4 to 6 and i was lost in a size 6. i went with a size 2 and it was perfect for sizing purposes i am a 34c and 5'3"" 112lbs..shirt is a bit lightweight so it is nice for summer or year round.",4,21/06/2018
"Comfy, but not flattering to larger busts","I really liked this top-- the red gingham is adorable, and it looked great tucked into the pencil skirt i was also trying on. sadly, it had two things going against it:
- when i didn't tuck it in, it looked like i was hiding an early pregnancy (it just hangs from the chest, and my bust is relatively large-- 34dd)
- the material is awfully thin, and i don't know how it would hold up (that's a concern when you're spending $90 on a ""casual"" top)
i would certainly consider purchasing this on sale",4,24/04/2018
Love this casual top,"This is the perfect summer top! lightweight and breezy. looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose. loved the blue one, so i came back to get the red one. (i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual.)",5,31/08/2018
Cute,I saw this top in store and immediately picked up the red one. i am usually a 6 in tops sometimes an 8 but ended up with a 4.  feels a little snug in the armpit area but doesn't look it. i ended up getting the honey color one which looks great with white and army green pants. i loved the red one but felt like i was wearing a picnic blanket. it is a little flimsy and probably won't last that long so if you want to wait for it to go on sale and hope they have your size i would do that.,4,07/10/2018
Super cute & comfy top!,"When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit",5,15/02/2018
Cute top,"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n",5,09/04/2018
Super cute but runs very large,"I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.",5,08/12/2018
Recommend on sale,This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.,3,02/03/2018
"Color is off, middle too wide.","I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.",2,17/06/2018
Better in person....,"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu",5,09/05/2018
Proper plaid,"This top is girl-next-door sweet. i'm mad about plaid so it was love at first sight for me! i love a blouse with a touch of spandex because i like the fitted look but not tight or loose, and spandex gives a bit of a yield. size 4 regular fits me well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at mid hip and the sleeves fall about 1/4"" pass my wrist (i plan to wear this top tucked in and the sleeves rolled up since the weather is warmer now). the color honey is versatile, blue motif has a",5,05/06/2018
"Easy, springy blouse","This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren",5,27/01/2018
Light weight and comfortable,This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie.,4,26/04/2018
Love it!,"This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!",5,17/07/2018

So good,"Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li",5,22/04/2018
Unique piece / boho chic,"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.

Shoulders are puffy,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.,3,13/06/2018
Better in person,"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.",5,03/06/2018

Maternity top,"Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning.",1,01/05/2018

Gorgeous color,"I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous, the fabric feels a bit weird, kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length, and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!",3,06/08/2018

Beautiful detail,"I have the white lemon lace shirt and love it so i was excited to see it in a color well suited for fall. the peacock pattern on the blouse i received is perfect and the pattern is well placed. i do love this one as much as the lemon blouse, however, the color is not the same as it appears online. it is more of a jade green color, and although it's pretty, i would have preferred it to look more of a blue color. i'm keeping it, as it is still an unusual and elegant blouse that's cute with dark sk",4,28/02/2018
Stunning color,Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!,5,18/04/2018
Beautiful blouse but too boxy/swingy,"The blouse is lovely - i loved the lace, color (though just as other reviewers mentioned its a darker blue closer to a teal color) and edging. i am very petite, for reference, 5'2"", 24 waist and 30e and normally wear a 00 or 00p. the 00 was still too wide for me around the waist/bottom and had too much of a swingy effect - it made me look like i was pregnant so i sadly returned. i wish this had more of a fitted look to it.",3,28/05/2018
"Gorgeous blouse, stunning color and pattern","This is a gorgeous high quality blouse. the color is stunning in person; i don't have anything like this color in my wardrobe. i'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this blouse in a 16. i am busty but the top still fit well. i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine; i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesn't apply to most people. if you're very thin and not busty you might be able to size down, but i'm honestly just not sure. i'm happy to say",5,25/06/2018
Nice mix of romantic and practical,"I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.",5,07/11/2018
Touch of class,I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.,5,14/07/2018
Very cute,"I loved this top when i tried it on in the store. i was very close to buying, but i knew my sister would want, so i moved on. it is a great fitting top. i am 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fit perfectly. i do question how well this top will fit petite people.",5,27/08/2018
True comparison,"I ordered this shirt in each color and different sizes: petite, regular, ""my"" size, a size up and one down!

verdict: i ended up in regular size, not petite because i felt the petite was jsut that short and i could feel te cold breeze in the store. i could have gone in the 00, 0, and 2 #2 is my usual size#, but ended up in a 0 only because it was less wide on me. it is, hwoevcer a tiny bit tighter around the back if i cross my arms forward #really, i don't do that move on a daily basis#. colr: i",4,17/10/2018
Love lace,"This top is lace done extremely well, i love the silk, the double attached layer, and the length. dress it up or down, this top is a definite show stopper.
it does run small in the arms though, size up!",5,06/09/2018
Unwearable but pretty,"I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two, if not three, sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body, other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough, especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w",1,21/03/2018
Vintage looking top,"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!",5,05/11/2018
Elegant & fun,"Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!",5,10/08/2018
Gorgeous top,"I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2"", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.",5,25/09/2018
Beautiful!,"I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.",5,17/08/2018
Makes me feel beautiful!,"I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes, because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a",5,06/04/2018
Perfect lace top,"I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.",5,28/02/2018
Beautiful fabric but unflattering fit,"Fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they didn't have it in my size (0) -- thought i'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well. alas, the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped. a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body, but on my slight frame it was not flattering. it's going back to retailer.",3,19/10/2018
"Great top, but not for a large bust","So many things to love about this top. if you're a fan of peplum tops - which i most definitely am - this is a great one. slightly shorter in front than in back. nice flare, but doesn't stick out too far. and overall, i thought it was well-made. i tried on the red in stores, and it looks a lot like the color in the photo. however, i'm a 36dd, and unfortunately, the top was just not large enough. totally squashed the girls, and there's basically no give in the fabric. i'm normally a 10/12, and ot",4,06/12/2018
"Very nice, but not for me","I did like this top, but it was a little big- i bought a size 4 and i have a size 32 chest. the color is great, the fabric is amazing, but it just didn't fit me perfectly. i thought about trying a smaller size, but i just wasn't sure that i would wear it a lot.",4,30/11/2018
Gorgeous.,"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome.",5,31/10/2018
"Beautiful red blouse, dress up dress down",Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find. this is more red in person that in the photo. great feel to material and the drape is wonderful. sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am (5'6 and 138 lbs) but this one has a nice slimming effect and the v-neck is complimentary to a smaller bust 36b. love it !!!!!!!,5,13/05/2018
Petra tank,"This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago, love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.",5,22/09/2018
Great top!,"Just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today. love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person. i typically wear a 2 in most retailer tops but i got a 0 in this and it is great - seems to be a generous fit. the slits on the sides do come up a bit high, but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it. looks great with jeans. it is a great transitional piece for the fall as i'm sure i will",5,30/04/2018
Sheer,"I absolutely love this top, the design and the cut. it is very long in the back. it is very flattering. i would have given it 5 stars except it is see through. i wish it didn't need a cami. layering tops gets old fast in the hot weather.",4,17/03/2018
Expensive circus-wear,"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical, fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all, and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic"", it would be difficult to",1,23/01/2018
Fun top!,"Top fiits true to size- i'm 5''6"", 132# and avg bra size. i orderd a 4 and it is great.i love the colors and the fabric is realy nice- what i would expect for this price point. the slit at the neck is not too low to be revealing. this would work well with jeans and just as well with dress pants for work.",5,21/08/2018
Wasn't sure at first,"But when i saw this top in person, urged by my stylist when they got it in, i decided to try it on. they had xs in store, my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look, and not sure if smaller would work, i decided to order all three: xxs, xsp and xxsp!

verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes, kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right, but arm holes were a little high, not as comfortable.
xsp ended up being the right c",5,09/11/2018
Like it but it is too loose,"I like this top. in the photo, the white in the print stands out. in-person, the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull, more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good, the print looks good. it is a swing top, looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down, could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.",3,19/02/2018
Maybe swing is for me!,"I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however, lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store, they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i",5,24/02/2018
Beautiful,"Very feminine, fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.",5,15/08/2018
"Pretty and feminine, but definitely size up!","I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!",5,29/07/2018
"All around a beautiful top, except for sizing","It's a cute top, but the only complaint i have is that it is difficult for me take off. it goes on easily, but i get always have a bit of a struggle trying to take it off. my shoulders tend to get stuck so i can't pull my arms out easily. i just wish the top had an extra button or two on the back or was made with material that allowed for some stretch without fear of destroying the lacework. i didn't want to size up another size because i have a petite body shape that would've been overwhelmed b",4,19/11/2018
Elegantly beautiful,"I have the pineapple dress from last year. when i saw this top with the lemons, i was in love. i don't usually pay this much for a top, but i had a special event coming up. i searched and searched, but nothing compared to the lemon top, so, with my birthday discount, i bit the bullet and ordered it. my first thought was that it didn't seem very substantial for the price. i decided to keep it though, because it is such a unique piece. i wore a beige cami underneath along with a beige skirt and it",5,03/02/2018
Kelby swing tank,"This is a beautiful shirt, however the cut and drape were off. i'm only 104 pounds, but this top made me look pregnant. the fabric jutted out at the front. it's a shame, because it really is lovely. i sent it back.",3,01/09/2018
A very special blouse,"The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images, which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected, and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone. 

it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips, you should expect",5,03/07/2018
Strange cut,I really wanted to love this top the material and pattern are lovely but the fit is strange. it looks like a maternity top on me and as another reviewer said it is right across the back but loose at arms and midsection. for the price i returned it.,3,26/01/2018
Love it!,"Beautiful material, great design. get a bigger size.",5,19/04/2018
Out of proportion,"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me.",3,21/04/2018
Love it!!!,I love this more than my pineapple top. i am 128lbs and wear between a size 2-4 in tops got this in size 4 (same as the pineapple) and fits perfectly and comfotably. the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern. i would say it runs a litle on the small side. material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels. in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely. they were so popular at the retailer near me tw,5,25/09/2018
High hopes,"I really wanted to love this. sadly, the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly, it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally, good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more, sigh. i really did want",3,28/03/2018
Lovely lace,I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.,5,12/09/2018
Pretty but tight fit,I tried this on in the store. i'm usually a 6 in tops but it was tight across the chest. i sized up to an 8 and it was still tight. i would have considered the 10 but with the 8 there was too much fabric on the bottom. overall design and material were good but the sizing was off.,3,23/06/2018
Totally sublime,"Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think",5,23/02/2018
"Beautiful, but",This top is beautiful and i really wanted to be able to keep it - i've tried it on 3 times. it is not for big-chested girls (34ddd) - it hangs like i'm 20 months pregnant because the top area lands on top of my chest. sadly this will be going back. it is beautiful and flowing and a perfect weight.,4,04/02/2018
Gorgeous but very small across back!,"I've been coveting the first edition of this top (pineapples) and was thrilled to find this same style with lemons. i called my local store and put a few sizes on hold so i could ensure the perfect fit. good job i did! the top is beautiful but it's super tight across the back - fine if you want to stand still & look pretty. if, however, you want to go about your usual activities, like eat for example, i'd suggest you size up. for reference i'm usually a 2-4 in retailer tops (34b, 5' 5"" and 130lbs)",4,27/01/2018
All the boxes checked,"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!",5,13/11/2018
Exquisite,"This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l",5,05/07/2018
Great for layering at work,"Cute shirt. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. size s fits perfectly. a little shorter in the back than i'd like but great for layering.",4,29/07/2018
Very chic,"Absolutely love the diagonal zipper. it is extremely flattering for the office, and comfortable. a great layering piece with a simple blazer, or alone. looks high quality. my only one minor complaint is that the bottom tends to move away from my body, as the top is wide on the bottom. hence, gives you a lot of leeway in the stomach area. may not be a good thing, or may be a good thing. still, overall, a keeper.",4,13/08/2018
Adorable and chic,"This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however, i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.",5,10/11/2018
Love this top!,"I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!",5,28/11/2018
Dreamy tunic,"Aaaaaaamazing tunic, it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on. the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top.",5,25/07/2018
Beautiful top!,"This top is beautiful. soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner. i am usually a 4, but sized up to an 8 to get a little more length. it drapes really nicely. i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual, put-together look or it can be dressed up easily, too. i'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline. it lays perfectly on me. highly recommend.",5,04/03/2018
Very short!!,"I love this fabric, and the design details of this top. but i am only 5'3, and this top ends above my waist! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering. i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much, but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is. tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out, for someone without a perfectly flat tummy.",3,27/02/2018
Love it,This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern. fell in love with the fabric. looks great with high-waist pants.,5,08/07/2018
Lovely fabric but not pretty design,"Despite the delicacy of the fabric and femininity of the patterns, the cut of this blouse is rather androgynous and not in a flattering or modern way. ick. so disappointed.",3,09/09/2018
Cute top,"I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.",5,13/06/2018
Got two colors!,"I ordered the navy, which is really stunning, by the way-and the cream. i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them! there you have it. that should say it all! it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which, if i'm not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you. the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue. as i said, my husband saw the cream colo",5,04/07/2018
Too sheer,"If you are over 25, this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric, but you can see right thru it.",2,26/01/2018
Beautiful fabric,This shirt is really quite cute. it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. it's also forgiving and quite flattering. my only concern is that it is a bit see through in certain lighting but it is very subtle. i definitely would recommend.,4,16/08/2018
Adorable but tuck in style for me,"Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.",5,22/06/2018
Not for the big busted,"I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it.",3,25/07/2018
Gorgeous print,"I fell in love with the print, it is much prettier in real life. more teal burgundy on yellow and more vivid than it shows here. the waist elastic is too tight and high for me....would prefer it looser and not on natural waist. but i still bought it and am ordering a second one in hopes that the elastic tightness is varied.",4,16/06/2018
Adorable top,"I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.",5,02/08/2018
Weird fit,"I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e",1,02/02/2018
"Cute, but wide","I'm. 5'2 and based on other reviewer's input, i went with a regular rather than petite and the length works well. the top is cute, but it billows out around the waist which isn't apparent on the model. other reviews mentioned that so i bought it anyway with that information and it's fine if you expect that. i'm a 34dd and find it to be a bit tight in the bust.",4,12/08/2018
"Gorgeous, well-made blouse - fits perfectly","This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it's a slight ""swing"" or ""trapeze"" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4"" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it's also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi",5,09/06/2018

Really cute but didn't work,"I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic, but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8, to give you an idea. i would recommend it, but it is going back for me.",3,08/11/2018
Worth a look,"I noticed this top on the sale rack and loved the color palette. it would be a nice top through spring, summer and into fall. the colors in it will go with lots of things in most wardrobes. the cut and style of the top are flattering and it feels good on my skin. i can see wearing a shawl with it is cooler weather or perhaps a cropped sweater. the cap at the top of the sleeve is cute, although i wish it extended just a bit longer. i tried a xs and an s. probably could have purchased the xs, but",4,01/10/2018

"Very nice, but also very flowey","I was surprised when my friend tried this on (they dind't have my size in store so she did), how ,uch materil there is on this top. it is very beautiful, but might be too much on a petite frame. the back is almost like a mini train, which is pretty ocol in my opinion. great colros in person too, yes, a tiny bit of shimmer :-)",4,27/09/2018
"Really wanted to like it, but...","This top is so pretty in the photos, but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size, but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made, so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference, i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly, but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect, but i'll sa",3,17/05/2018
So disappointed,I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!,2,06/03/2018
Swanky fun!,This elegant tank made me feel as if i had been transported to downton abbey. the velvet trim and the lovely embellishments of sparkle have an art deco delight. the swing of the fabric was playful and flattering. it's easy to dress up and dress down. fantastic top!,5,25/05/2018
Odd color...,"I wanted to love this top... it's gorgeous w/the beading and velvet. however, it really goes with nothing. i'm tall and slender... the top felt a bit cropped when i tried it on. very wide flare shape... but that wouldn't make me return it. what is making me send it back is the color. the grey is gorgeous, but the fabric is a buttery yellow color. i think i was picturing it more cream. i don't know what in the world you could wear this with... grey pants?! a grey pencil skirt?! it looks terrible",4,09/11/2018
Gorgeous but pricey,"I tried this on in the store to see if it would be my go to party top and splurge this season. i love the colors, textures, and embellishments. so lovely! ultimately the price and the very flowy fit (particularly in the back) made me put it back. another great item from moulinette soeurs, though!",4,29/10/2018
Sparkle with delight,"I am an hourglass figure with a d cup. i rarely wear trapeze tops, as they make me appear larger. this is a very lovely top! fits nice (i was a medium) and hits nicely around hips (i'm 5'4). perfect for a special night out.",5,11/11/2018
Beautiful but maternity feel and look,"I had a feeling this might not work for me, so i decided to try it on in the store just to verify. i was quite right. i'm a tall gal with a size 36c, and it just billowed out and made me look wider. i normally wear a size m in tops and even this was a tad loose.

if you're petite/smaller framed, this will probably work for you. if you're tall and busty, this doesn't do us gals any favors, in my opinion.

it is a lovely top, and i loved the velvet trim at the bottom, the inner lining was decent,",3,26/02/2018
Love the art deco detail on this versatile top!,Can't wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you don't need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of,5,08/12/2018
Gorgeous top!,I'm obsessed with this top! i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments. the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person.,5,07/06/2018
Perfect summer tank,This is such a cute and unique top. the fabric is substantial linen but a little rough.. i went with my regular size but the straps are a little loose. i am thinking of having them altered. planning on wearing this with a bandeau. perfect for summer,4,14/06/2018
Had me at first glance,"I saw this top online and had to buy it immediate (which is rare for me). it looked loose and forgiving but had a polished look. it didn't disappoint when i tried it on. however, the straps are a bit loose and will need to be altered. the linen fabric can be rough or itchy, but still a gorgeous top!",3,01/02/2018
Pretty and kind of unique,"I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars, yes, this top is for a strapless bra, my bra top (where the strap starts
0 was showing, but so nice... shape was ok for me, it does go in at the hem, givinng a bubble-like shape, but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps, but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store, but checked, and yes, that's true... love it.

not an online exclusive, as it was in my store, i pur",5,03/06/2018
Straps are too long,"This top has a nice print and material.  being a full figure, it helps when a material stays put instead of being too flowy.  not very keen about the straps.  they're a bit longer for me, so they don't stay on my shoulders.  i'll keep it and adjust the straps.",4,08/09/2018
Not exactly what i hoped for,"First of all, this top is brown and light beige. i was expecting more of a dark grey and cream. it also has very noticeable stitching that is a very reddish brown. cute, but a little different from what i imagined. the fabric is a casual linen. regarding the fit, i am 5'6"", 123lbs. 27 inch waist, 32d. i ordered the 4 and it fit well. as other reviews have mentioned, the straps are long so the top of the shirt hangs fairly low. i did not find this to be flattering. it made my bust look low and my",3,23/03/2018
Super cute!,"Love this top- great for summer- unique in the print. feels great on, a little loose but great for a hot texas summer.",4,05/12/2018
Black muted camisole,Excellent quality! i love this camisole with it's muted shades of black. based on other reviews i sized down from my usual 4 to a size 2 and the fit was perfect and no problems with the straps being to long. a keeper!,5,10/11/2018
Cute and flowy,"I'm happy i bought this top. it's very cute and almost a little immature/childish, but with the right bottoms it looks classy. i found it to run large so i sized down one size and it fits good, though the straps can feel a little tight if it rides up. it washes beautifully. will probably not work on large chested women.",4,20/04/2018
"Gorgeous fabric, but fit is loose","I absolutely love the print on this fabric, and the linen blend is perfect for warmer weather. i do wish this top was more fitted overall--it seems like the silhouette is a bit looser than is ideal. however, i'm keeping this and wearing it!
i'm 5'2"", 95 lbs, and ordered the 00 petite.",4,14/07/2018
Well made detailed,"My size is 4 but because they did not have it i ordered 6. a little big but i can fix it. 
the price was very nice. 
i thought it said gray but what i got is more brown.",4,03/08/2018
Great tunic!,"I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me, but i am busty.",5,11/05/2018
"Pretty, but boxy","I really liked this top, but it was very expensive even when on sale, and it ended up being boxy. i am flat-chested (32a), 5'7'. if i remember correctly, i tried on the xs. it was cute, but it wasn't flattering because it was so boxy on my frame. perhaps it'd be more flattering on other body shapes. i think it would be cuter if it was a bit more fitted. otherwise, the quality seemed great, though i'd be worried about all the beading falling off eventually.",4,02/03/2018
Lovely top,"Beautiful and comfortable, although it is a lot looser at the bottom than pictured, and the slit on the sides is quite high. not deal breakers though!",5,21/08/2018
Poor quality control,"I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br",1,22/10/2018
Better in real life,"Bought this in store at full price: it's that pretty. black & white, embroidery, pintucks! throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy. my only prob was i had to buy a little large - size 8- as size 6 was already sold out. 
i am 5' 5"" , 130 lbs.",5,04/09/2018
Love this shirt,"This is a gorgeous shirt. it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture, where it looks more shapeless. even though i love tunics, the online picture wasn't appealing to me -- but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it. wore it to work today and loved it even more. it's great quality, gorgeous design, lovely tailoring and details throughout.",5,26/11/2018
So cute!,"I bought this in store yesterday in a 2 petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (4 petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows, and it's really cute that way too.",5,26/04/2018
Versatile and unique,"I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much",5,21/03/2018
Beautiful tiered tank with embroidery for summer,"I bought this tank to go with the navy wide legs pants shown in the picture.  i bought this top in a 12 and could have gone a size down.  i'm very small chested.  i think that for someone with a larger chest it is probably more true to size.  i wanted the extra length, so i'm keeping the 12.  i'm 6 ft, 175 lbs and usually wear a medium or large (10/12) in retailer tops. the layering of the top is very pretty, as is the embroidery.",4,05/12/2018
Obsessed,I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.,5,01/04/2018
"Pretty, but not for me...","I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;)",4,11/04/2018
Excited ... but ...,"I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.",5,27/01/2018
Beautiful shirt but runs small!,Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn't fit me.,4,24/01/2018
Beautiful,I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.,4,02/07/2018
Perfect fall shirt!,"The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.",5,11/02/2018
"Beautiful, stunning, cozy top!","I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)",5,04/02/2018
Cozy casual - perfect for fall,"The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.
the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.
i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.",5,31/03/2018
So beautiful! gorgeous orange color!,"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",5,31/01/2018
Runs short,I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer,4,24/08/2018
Cute top,"This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.",5,04/03/2018
Adorable,"I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it's a little sheer, so you'd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it's a great top for spring/summer!",4,31/07/2018
Didn't work for me,"I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small.",3,11/07/2018
Beautiful top!,"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3""). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)",5,14/02/2018
Love this blouse,"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked.",5,22/02/2018
Better in person,"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p",5,25/09/2018
Cuter is person,Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.,4,10/03/2018
Airy and flattering,The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.,5,18/03/2018
"Cute top, but not for me","This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.",3,13/03/2018
"Nice, runs small and short","I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.",3,01/09/2018
Cute but ...,"This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn't make it work
.",3,18/05/2018
Subdued sexy,"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not",5,03/02/2018
I wanted to love it...,"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.",2,24/10/2018
Too billowy,"Bought this top at my local store and tried it on as soon as i got home. yikes! it was way too billowy, i looked like i was pregnant. will be trying the next size down on in the store to see if it is billowy.",3,24/01/2018
Must see in person,"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",5,12/08/2018
Stunning top,"Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist",5,21/02/2018
Love!!!,I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!,5,12/02/2018
Happy top!,"In the midst of the end-of-winter doldrums, i tried this cute top on. springy. powdery. happy. the lace is soft, not too stiff or scratchy, and lightweight enough to transition nicely into summer. because the cami is a separate piece, i also envision wearing this as a top over a slip-dress with some retro mary janes. the sleeve length makes it fair game for late winter, too. yay!",4,30/05/2018
Wanted to love it,"An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.",2,06/11/2018
"Great overall, but with it's issues","This top is really pretty and i received a lot of compliments on it. i said it ran true to size, but really the torso part runs a little big. if i had sized down, i think it would have been too tight in the arms. the cami that came with it kept falling out, which is no big deal, but be aware that the strings might not hold the cami with the shirt. overall, it's a really pretty blue and the details make it worth it.",4,11/11/2018
"Cute shirt, but not for me",The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.,5,17/10/2018
Not as pictured,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,2,27/10/2018
Stunning!,"I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!",5,03/09/2018
Soft and beautiful,No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft. i couldn't pass it up and wish it came in more colors!,5,01/08/2018
Defined waist,"Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu",5,26/02/2018
Great twist on a classic,"As a curvy, short gal, finding a nice button down that isn't boxy or way too low cut is like finding a gem. this shirt is perfect for work, and i love how flattering it is. my only reservation is that it is more sheer than i would like, and so i need a camisole with it. i wish this style came in more colors!",4,01/04/2018
Wearable,"I love this shirt. great mix of chic, comfortable and feminine! can wear for many occasions!",5,17/10/2018
"Beautiful design, very sheer","I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed, but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!",3,11/05/2018
Nice shape but thin,"I have mixed feelings about htis top, it is a nice shape and comfortable, fits triue t o size, but hte fabric is thin adn sheer. i decided to keep in mind if it goes on sale. the 0 fit me perfectly. (115 lbs, 3-dd chest).",3,24/03/2018
Great blouse with a twist,"I had to go up one size, but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work, and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest, but the next size up fit perfect!",5,28/10/2018
Feminie and structured,"I love this blouse. it is perfect for a curvy figure. i think it runs true to size. maybe size up if you have a larger chest. i love how it is so feminine yet structured. the fabric is lovely, soft and structured all at once. love the knot, i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldn't leave the store without it. it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay $$$ for a perfect fit!",5,28/06/2018
Cute top but not for the price,"The top is really cute, but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.",3,29/05/2018
Small and see-through,"I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work, but when i tried it on, i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through, and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return, unfortunately. if the top came in other colors, i would return for a larger size, but i can't deal with see-through work tops.",3,27/07/2018
Perfect white blouse!,"I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies), and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect, fitted, white, button-down blouse for weeks, and i love this top! it's figure flattering, true to size, and a cute, classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]",5,15/09/2018
Size up if you're busty,"I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile, and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures, but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft, not crisp, and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing, though. it's a bit sheer, but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular, rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2, but had to size up to a 4 regular to avoid gaping in f",5,14/11/2018

Pros & cons,"I am 5' 8"", 145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore, i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however, the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore, i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j",3,08/04/2018
Soft & pretty!,"I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture, it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters), so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0, but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie, it can be cinched in to create",5,29/07/2018
Beautiful top with odd fit,"This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom, which normally i like, but not this time. sad.",3,27/01/2018
Fit issues for a curvy gal,"First off, the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling, the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however, i just couldn't get past the fit issue, which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest, and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me, but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else, but i had to ret",3,05/10/2018
Unflattering,"As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist, i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short, too wide in the hips, and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.",2,25/02/2018
Beautiful top!,"I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)",5,03/02/2018
Too big....,"This is a beautiful blouse but needs to be returned for size. i have lost a bit of weight; the last couple of blouses i have gotten in a m (including this one) have been to large for me. i am 5'5"" tall, 138 lbs and in this blouse need a s. the fabric is satiny and substantial with a gorgeous lining edged in contrasting thread., it hits at the top of my thigh in a regular size 8 but i should have ordered a 6. i would say to size down if you are close to being between sizes. the colors are as show",3,29/05/2018
"Love, love, love it!","Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful, ordered it, shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!
i wore it last night to a st patrick's day party in california and received a ton of compliments. paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels. 
i'm still smiling today, can't wait to wear it again. the fit is flattering and the quality superb.
thanks retailer",5,22/01/2018
Gorgeous!,This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. can't wait to wear!,5,02/05/2018
"Lovely, but odd fit","I really wanted to love this top, but the fit was just off on me. the design and material is so pretty. however, i expected the fit to be more ""peplum"", but there was not any structure. i think this would be better on more slender women.",4,17/11/2018
Super cute top,Love the way this top fits. got many compliments on it! wish the arm holes were a little closer fit - can see the bra peeking out a teensy bit.,4,01/09/2018
This top is the bomb!,I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!,5,23/03/2018
Busty ladies size up,This is a wonderfully-made top. i love the colors! if you are busty you must size up! this fabric doesn't give (stretch) at all.,4,21/05/2018
A piece of art,"Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price, but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!",5,21/08/2018
Not right for every body type.,"I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10, even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa",3,19/03/2018
Loving it,Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.,5,23/03/2018
Like wearing a beautiful painting,"The retailer by me actually had this and i had to try it on. my thoughts below:
___________
pros:
- well-constructed with lining underneath to avoid the need of a cami or tank. no see-through issues whatsoever.
- the fabric is great quality and looks nicely sewn. no fraying or strays seen on the 2 sizes i tried.
- there's a back zipper that goes from top to bottom at the back. unusual as i don't see why that's needed since you can just slip it over your head.
- front ""v slit"" isn't too low or reve",4,08/02/2018
Shirt is beautifully made,"Sadly, this shirt was too short for me. i'm 5'11"" and have had a hard time with some of retailer's shirts lately. but it is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels expensive and it's well made.",4,09/11/2018
Pretty tank,"It is a pretty tank, the fabric feels nice and substantial.",4,16/05/2018
Triangles aren't my shape,"So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have",2,29/08/2018
"Interesting blouse, some limitations","This blouse is basically a rectangular piece of fabric that is folded over and sewn up the sides. the side seams are about 2-3 inches in from the edge of the fabric. the neck opening is finished nicely. the fabric has a nice drape to it, but the design on the front isn't as crisp and clear as i thought it would be; the design is a bit fuzzy. so i wish the picture on the front were clearer. i always wear an xl in retailer tops, but the size l in this fit nicely in the bust except is too snug at the",4,07/06/2018
Pretty but sleeves make it seem large.,I lived the front and back designs but didn't like the fit.,3,02/09/2018
"Flirty, fun","Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it's summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.",5,03/06/2018
Lovely fall top,Love this top! tried it on in the store & loved it more. it's a great transitional piece with rich colors. the top is sheer so will need to layer with a camisole. haven't worn yet so can't speak to how well it will wash.,5,27/06/2018
Stiff fabric,"I normally am a xl or size 18 in fabric tops (if they're not knit and do not stretch.) but, this looked to be a bit boxy and so i bought the 16 and it fit fine. it fit like on the model....tailored, but loose and not really a lot of fabric or boxy.

now, the fabric is stiff. and, it's sheer. but, the pockets land where your breasts are. so, i wore this with a nude bra and it's just like in the photo. there are peeks but you don't see anything. however, if this is for work, i'd put a cami under",4,10/04/2018
Love it!,"Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.
great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.",5,08/10/2018
Cute and stylish,"I bought this top in hopes of getting a lot of wears out of it as we transition from summer to fall. the color is a pretty rust color perfect for fall, but also great for late summer. i love the leaf print, and the dark buttons on the sides really take the top to the next level. i love wearing this top with my high-waisted flare jeans, i get tons of compliments when i wear this top! it is definitely sheer, which i like, so i wish that it came with its own detachable camisole (the reason i took a",4,07/03/2018
"Very pretty blouse, just as pictured","I liked this blouse very much the minute i first seen it, it looks exactly as pictured but sits much better in person. i'm 6ft tall 160lb ordered a 10 which was true to size with a little more room to the bottom. i was able to see my belly button through the sheer part of the bottom fabric, but as soon as i sucked my belly in, it was fine. the quality of the fabric is so-so i had some threads hanging out here and there, but this top looks very good in person and the design is unique, you can hav",5,30/10/2018
Pros and cons,"I tried this in the store after looking at it online. the material was soft and flexible which was nice - i had been concerned that it might be stiff. however, it was a bit difficult to get on and off with the zipper on the back and the high neckline. overall, as a petite person, i felt the spots were too overwhelming for me. but if you like the spots, and have no trouble with back zippers, go for it.",4,09/06/2018
Great too,"I really love this top. it's cute, whimsical, and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it's a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it, especially during the tag sale.",5,21/10/2018
Cute.....but odd color,"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however, i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size.",3,03/03/2018
Order a size up!,"What an adorable, classic style fringed top this is! i recently purchased this in my regular size but i should've read the reviews first and ordered a size up. when i went up from a size 6 to an 8 (34d-27-35), it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on! i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed. it looks very flapper girl;) i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt!",5,02/12/2018
Disappointed,"So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.
the constr",2,16/02/2018
Strange fit,"This is a beautiful piece but the cut is not flattering. i ordered my usual small and while the top fit, the fringed part was huge, kind of ""maternity."" i can only imagine there was some clothes-pinning going on for the photo. this would have been great if it had about 4 inches of fabric removed from the lower part. obviously, it cannot be altered. so sad, must return.",3,26/07/2018
Unique and timeless,"I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t",5,10/02/2018
?????? love this blouse,"For me this is the perfect blouse. alone or with a cardigan it's a winner. not too low cut, armholes are perfect. i would buy other colors if they were available.",5,23/09/2018
Great top - versatile and well made,"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",5,16/02/2018
"Cute casual top, but note length","I am 5'6"" and wear a medium. i ordered an 8 and a 10 and am keeping the 10, which is a little large but, importantly, is a full 2 inches longer than the 8. this is important to me because several of my casual pants begin a couple of inches below the waist and, as noted by another reviewer, and as is evident on the model, the top hits just below the waist. also, it is cotton/linen and may shrink (since it is ivory, i assume it will see a few washings). i don't want to worry about the ""gap"", but i",4,25/06/2018
"Spring, summer, fall","This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans, linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too. 
i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft, but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall, thin, without much figure. it's not cheap, but something i'll likely keep for a few years.",5,09/03/2018
Beautiful spring top,"I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it! when my usual size 2 was unavailable, i sized down to a 0 because it looked plenty big and it fits fine. i bought the ivory color and love it! i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts. it's a lovely shade of ivory, quite flattering. boxy tops are often not for me, but this one is perfect!",5,11/02/2018
Love this shirt,I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.,5,04/10/2018
Perfect basic!,"Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it, you will have it forever!",5,11/02/2018
Love this top!,The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!,5,22/08/2018
Nice top,"This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area, but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!",5,15/10/2018
Versatile piece! glad i did not order the petite.,"I'm consistently a 0p in this brand, but i ordered a regular zero, and i'm glad i did not get the petite because it would have been too cropped for me. it's a bit boxy, and the material is thicker than i thought, but it is a versatile piece that look forward to wearing!",4,13/04/2018
Flattering cut,"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.",5,21/07/2018
"Love, love, love it!","Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1"", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!
this is a keeper.",5,03/09/2018
Love,"This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.",5,28/09/2018
Perfect,Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!,5,17/07/2018
Loved it but it ran. . .,"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.",1,29/03/2018
Beautiful quality and fit! summertime!,"I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium, size 8, short-waisted, 34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique, appealing design, excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right, the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!), the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme, and finally, admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di",5,27/09/2018
Flowy perfection!,"I have to admit, seeing these tops online, i wouldn't give them a second glance, but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy (my summer checklist!) i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl. i am a 16/xl/36h and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit! i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously, but there is no pulling. this top does run long,",5,20/05/2018
Meh,"This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering, it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.",3,18/07/2018
Runs huge!,"This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small, but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy, which is perfect for warm days, but the size issue is out of control!",2,11/03/2018
Love!,"I bought one of these in store and then ordered two more online! i love this top. it's loose and hangs just right. i have gotten so many compliments on it. very comfy and cute. pockets too, which is always a plus.",5,26/01/2018
Good in theory but too large,"I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.",2,23/10/2018
"Cute top, a bit too low cut for me",I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,4,22/10/2018

Runs very large,"Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think, it's way baggy",3,26/03/2018
I wanted to like this,"I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft, , but the pattern is undistinguished. 
the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy, the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.",1,27/02/2018
Beautiful and elegant tank,"I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t",5,12/05/2018
Winner,"This top is so pretty and easy to wear. the material is super soft, it's long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked. the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off! great purchase on retailer weekend, i'd be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale.",5,21/10/2018
Great quality chambray top,"Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.",5,23/10/2018
Love! so comfy and chic,"This top is so beautiful and well made, and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before, and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet, but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this, you won't regret it!",5,08/02/2018
Love love love,"This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!",5,31/03/2018
Staple with a twist,"Love the crochet detail on the back. yes, it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.",5,12/10/2018
Beautiful material and back crochet,"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive, but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts, jeans, and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",5,27/07/2018
Pretty top,"I adore maeve tops, and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a), ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely, but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on, either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit, so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing",5,03/02/2018
A line,"This is a beautiful blouse. very pretty and looks well made. unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm looking for a more classic cut. it has an a line/tent shape. when i put it on and put my arms above my head, the bottom of the blouse was up to my bra!

Beautiful find,"This is a unique blouse, it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit, but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product. 
the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.",5,13/02/2018
"Beautiful, elegant, quirky summer top","Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer, and i quickly make the purchase without any regret.
without being stuffy or old, this top is simply elegant. the floral is very high-end designer (think italian made) for a fraction of the cost. made of 100% bamboo, it is light without being sheer. there is no need for a cami with this one. the fabric has the body of a good linen, but it doesn't wrinkle nearly as much. it does require dry cleaning, though, if this matters to you.",5,28/10/2018
Love,Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.,5,21/10/2018

Pretty but weird fit,"I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs, 32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.",2,09/06/2018
Really pretty but sizing off my for me,Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,2,15/10/2018
Disappointed,"Sleeves were tight, was difficult to put on ?. for the price, you want to love the shirt. sending it back.",2,12/03/2018
Beautiful top,"This is a beautiful top but the fit is odd. it's roomy and flowy in the bust and waist but the arms are disproportionately tight. i wear a size 8 in all hd in paris tops but this one didn't fit anything like the others. i wouldn't even know what size to recommend because it's almost too big in the body, while being too tight in the arms. the lace and mock neck is beautiful though so i'm hoping to find someway to wear it comfortably. otherwise, it will be going back.",3,22/11/2018
So sad!,"I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in, it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.",2,27/09/2018
Not impressed,"This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it
on. too bad, but it went back",2,10/11/2018
Stunning!,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,5,06/12/2018
Not as pictured -- better!,"This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.",5,30/01/2018
Blue green,"This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.",5,09/10/2018
Really nice,It's just not for me and i really like it. it's made very well and it looks great from the front. not so much from the side. i'm a 36c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chest...so much that i will be returning it. i look like i have an extra 20 lbs. on me.,5,13/05/2018
Must see detail,"The pictures of this blouse simply don't do it justice. the floral details are gorgeous. i liked it when i ordered it, but loved it on. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, ordered the size 4 and it fit perfectly.",5,06/06/2018
Epic,"I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.",5,08/04/2018
"Too beautiful to be a ""tank""","When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s",5,15/09/2018
This is unusual and very pretty...,"...but it does have it's problems. the neck, although it has pretty button detail at the back, is very outsized on me. i would like to see it fit a bit more snugly as by not laying flat, necklaces bunch up and are hard to wear with it. it is just sort of 'floppy' if i'm making sense. the camisole liner is nicely made and attaches with snaps at the shoulders which gives this a definite plus. the fabric is sort of like chiffon with appliquã©d flowers. the color combination is beautiful and with the",4,13/04/2018
Beautiful,"I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering, but then i'm not very busty, so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only, but well worth it for such a unique, pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.",5,15/09/2018
Great shape stiff fabric,"Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick, stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer",3,03/08/2018
Beautiful blouse!,"This is a gorgeous blouse. the quality is on point. i was so disappointed because i had to return it.
the blouse was just a few inches too tight across the bust.",5,25/10/2018
Love it... but size up!,"I love this top and was so happy when it came out in black! i'm typically an 8 on top and sized up to a 10, and it still feels slightly small across the shoulders and arms. it also requires a under tank because it's very sheer, even with the lining. worth it though!",4,10/11/2018
Really cute top,This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.,5,03/04/2018
Beautiful top,"Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6.",5,24/04/2018
Beware of washing,"Absolutely beautiful top, worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(",1,19/11/2018
Awkward fit,"I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it's gorgeous.",2,17/07/2018
Black bleeds on cream!,"This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur",1,14/09/2018
Love pattern,I love this top.the only thing negative is how thin and cheap the material feels.,4,18/07/2018
Elegant top,"I was very excited when this top arrived in the mail! it is so, so beautiful. i love the material and the brightness of the colors. it will be a perfect top this holiday season.",5,06/07/2018
Strange!,"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details , but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out, but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope",1,29/10/2018
"Gorgeous, but it runs a little big.","Beautifully made, incredible beadwork and detail. sleeves are extra long and a bit heavy (and cinched in multiple places, which feels strange), but the blouse is *gorgeous* and absolutely perfect for autumn. i'm gonna return and buy the size down.",4,12/10/2018
Beautiful top!,"When i received this top, i thought it was even prettier than the online picture. the colors and beading are more vibrant in person. it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on. i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture. it is pretty shear. if you wear it to work or during the daytime, it will need a cami. however, in evening lighting, i don't find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing",5,28/02/2018
Lovely,"I love this tunic, i wore it with black leggings and boots. it is well made and flowy. i wish it came in more colors.",5,07/04/2018
Classy shell.,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) -32-40, and a solid size 10. the size 10 fit me perfectly, but if it shrank it would be too tight across the bust. the size 12 also fit me well but was an inch looser all around. the darts on the 12 hit me in exactly the right place, so i decided to go with the 12, even though it looks a little big. it makes me look smaller.

Silly short,This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.,1,17/04/2018
So cutest,Ok. love this top. i'm 5'4 106 34b and the 0 reg fits perfect on the top half. i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top. it is very short. i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough. i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige. great with jeans or navy for work.,4,09/07/2018
Cute but hits a little short,"I really wanted to love this top! it's cute and fitted- fits well, but just hit me a tad higher than i wanted. i tried a size 2 and it fit perfectly--but with no extra room. i'm 5'5""-34c. normally wear a 2.",4,22/01/2018
Pretty top,"This top is really cute for the right body shape.
it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape.",4,22/02/2018
Short,I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.,3,28/10/2018
"Cute idea, bad cut",I wanted to love this top to go with a pair of red flats i also bought at retailer. but it's almost like a peplum crop top because the cut is short. the peplum piece also flares out rather dramatically. had to return it even though i love other tops from maeve.,3,29/11/2018
Easy breezy summer top,"I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer, so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro",5,03/08/2018
Lovely interesting white top,"I bought this in my usual size small, and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami, but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c, 28-38, 5'3"". it has an elegant, arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest, i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you.",5,02/05/2018
"So cute, but size up!!","This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.",5,13/08/2018
Too studious for words,"Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also, i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large), but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows, i would size up. i love the unique design!",5,28/04/2018
Beautiful!,"I agree with other reviewers, this print is beautiful, i'd love to see the artists other work...
however, the price is steep for sure!
i was hoping to wear this with my skinny jeans but it is waaaay too short for that! i have an extra long torso so this is not an unusual problem for me, but this one is worse than usual almost like a crop top. unlike other reviewers tho, i would not want to size up. it fits snugly but not tight. the fabric doesn't give much tho, so if you're on the verge of siz",4,06/11/2018
Beautiful and quirky!,"This may be one of my favorite purchases from retailer in a long time. i really appreciate the unique design, a quality that has drawn me to retailer for years. the cute little quirky owls are as rich in color as they are in personality. i'm don't typically favor cheaper polyester blends though the texture feels fine on my skin. this top definitely runs small and i had to size up to get the fit and length i desired. overall, i am very pleased and have received lots of compliments after wearin",4,21/07/2018
I recommend with caveats,"I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer",2,14/10/2018
Requires layering and made for the long wasted,"This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however, if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique.",3,31/01/2018
"Unique and comfortable top, easy to wear.","I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built",5,23/05/2018
Beautifully unique top,"I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also, the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!",5,17/05/2018
Print looks odd,This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.,3,12/03/2018
Better in person,"I think it's prettier in person. the color is a little brighter in reality, and the beading on the lower half is in 2 colors (green and gray), which isn't apparent in the photo. although i would consider it true to size, it's a full looking top. i'm 5'8', and both the sleeves and the length are not as long on me as they are on the model. it's a bit sheer, but i personally found it to be fine with a nude bra. cute vintage look.",4,24/02/2018
Even nicer in person,"Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.",5,11/06/2018
Much cuter in the picture,"This top runs small across the top. i was amazed at the material--polyester, i am sure--because the price was so high. it has a sheer layer underneath, which i think would make it hot in the summer. i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online.",3,08/07/2018
Adorable tank!,"I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!",5,08/08/2018
Down with drycleaning,The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.,2,12/06/2018
Great design with cheap fabric. not worth it.,"Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.",2,02/11/2018
"Great fabric, but...","I like what they were going for here, and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras, and the very wide neck also shows bra straps, so unless i want to go with a strapless bra, it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without, but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb",3,30/03/2018
Nice but....,"I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however, i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd, 5'3, and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go",3,29/10/2018
Cute and unique!,"I love this top! i gave it a four star because i wish it were a tad longer. i am short... 5'-1 and it does work for me, but i do tend to like my tops longer. very cute and airy in the back!",4,16/08/2018
Beautiful top,"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.",5,03/07/2018
Boxy and short,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,1,27/03/2018
Uniform top,"I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th",5,05/08/2018
Weird fit,"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",2,05/07/2018
Beautiful - if you're pregnant with twins.,"This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.",2,02/03/2018
If you love cotton and feminine details...,"This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly (size 8 top, 34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore",5,13/08/2018
Wanted to love...,"I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",1,18/11/2018
Classy and good quality!,"I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it.  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly!  i am 5'2"", 120# with broad shoulders.  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels.   definitely a keeper!  as a petite gal, this was not overly long.  if you have larger hips, this will not hang well.",5,27/07/2018
Very sheer and shorter than shown,"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

Needs a better discription,"I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer, my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender, but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...

This product has a cute design and nice fabric.,This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.,5,11/08/2018
Very boxy,Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,2,01/02/2018
Really wanted to like it,Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.,2,16/05/2018
Photos on model misleading,"The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra, no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top, because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package, it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated, it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the",2,09/02/2018
"Unique, gorgeous and timeless!",Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!,5,12/03/2018
Nice details,"This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!",5,24/04/2018
Perfection,"Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse, i purchased this blouse. it's true to size, size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich, a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it, and of course, the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect, feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly",5,30/09/2018
Cute boho fall blouse,"Loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i'm not a fan of. mine was mostly cut from the ""mum/sunflower"" patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern. the shirt online as a good combo of patterns-- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print! way overboard!! that said-- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail-- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic!",4,23/01/2018
Beautiful peasant top,"For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse, a mix of various floral swatches, is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!",5,19/10/2018
Runs large,"The top is a pretty and has a nice pattern. it does run large and is it a bit billowy. i am 5'4 petite and ordered a small ( maybe the xs would have been better). however, the top swallowed me up and was unflattering. the colors are true to the picture..not very bright, but would be a nice transition to fall top.
the feel of the blouse was nice and maybe if i was taller and ordered a smaller size it would have been better.",3,23/09/2018
Unique,"I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!",5,05/06/2018
This is another ubiquitous swing top,"Yes, it's a swing top, just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me, being top heavy, so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge, with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top, which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.",3,01/10/2018
I love denim,"I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim, or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt, the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.",5,27/09/2018
Huge and shortedr than appears in picture,This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.,2,31/08/2018
Oversized,"This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l, if not a medium. sadly, it's going back :( otherwise, it's high quality and a beautiful design.",3,20/11/2018
Weird arms!,The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.,3,03/08/2018
Arm candy!,"I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though, because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that wasn't the case this time around. i'm 5'4"" 130-135lbs, depending on my appetite!",5,10/09/2018
Long arms,This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.,3,18/11/2018
Much thinner,"I was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top. it's also see-through but i'm not bothered by that. it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms. but overall, i didn't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin. it's going back...",3,20/11/2018
Very versatile,"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",5,31/03/2018
Stiff material,"I found the material a little stiff, im asummig linen is stiff at first. i got an xxs and fit tts in my case (34 b, 5'7, 120 lb).",5,26/04/2018
Classic and unique,"Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details. super soft great quality fabric, and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest. can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts. really happy with it. fits loose, but tts.",5,28/05/2018
Very versatile,"I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes, it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.",5,06/02/2018
Pretty shirt!,I loved the cut out features on the shoulders of this shirt. it has the palest tone as pictured and will be cute with jeans this summer and on vacation. i took one star away because the body is cut rather large. i tested the center back fit and that was fine. i wish the body was a little more narrow.,4,27/01/2018
Super cute!,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",5,30/04/2018
Cute as it is comfy,"This is a very flattering and comfortable top that can easily transition into fall. i can't wait to wear it (i have the black and white one) under my new leather jacket! the store was out of my size, so i had to order the top, which came with a small snag. i trimmed the thread and wore it anyway! it is also long enough to wear with leggings.",4,09/11/2018
Don't miss this top,"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",5,12/06/2018
I wish i had bought it in every color,"This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!",5,20/09/2018
Darling summer top,"I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.",5,27/08/2018
Love it!,"If you're looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i'm not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer",5,24/06/2018
Got the last one !,"I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.",5,08/08/2018
Darling top!,"Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.",5,18/10/2018
Buy this shirt before it sells out,This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!,5,20/04/2018
Cute top,"I didn't love it enough to buy it, but did think it was cute. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.",4,27/07/2018
Very flattering!,"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",5,14/11/2018
Cute top,Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,5,08/09/2018
Adorable top,I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,5,02/07/2018
Love this tunic!,"This is figure featuring without being too tight. it fits exactly like the picture. it is a bit pricey, but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan. i love it!",5,26/07/2018
Beautiful blouse,"This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru, so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however, be extra careful when you do wear it. i'm still not quite sure how it happened, but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it's so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w",5,25/11/2018
Western shirt with a feminine flare,"This shirt is actually not as fitted as it looks on the model. the shirt actually flares out a bit and giving more room to large chested women, like myself. the arms and chest area are a tat small, but the non-fitted style accommodated that nicely. great color, great design with the butterflies and easy to wash. looks great with skinny bell bottoms or even jean shorts in the summer and some cowboy boots. very sexy.",4,04/10/2018
Stunning classic,"This is such a beautiful shirt! for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34b) it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up. the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average. the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an im-modest way. i do not feel the need to wear anything under it.",5,15/03/2018
Love it,I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :),5,31/10/2018
Very cute top!,The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect. so many tops now are on the longer side or have the high/low hems. this one is great....love it. kinda want the white one now!,5,24/07/2018
Pretty but very short,"This is a beautiful and well-made top; sadly it just didn't work for me. i'm 5'1 with a pretty short waist and even on me it was too short. the shortness might've worked if it wasn't as baggy as it was. i don't mind baggy, loose-fitting tops, but this was so much so that it was just unflattering; it looked a bit boxy as well.",3,25/05/2018
"Cute top, but short and boxy","Nicely made, pretty details, but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!",3,22/09/2018
Cute in theory,"This is a gorgeous top; however, it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?",3,14/08/2018
Sweet shirt!,"This is a light, so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!",5,06/06/2018
Gorgeous white blouse,I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.,5,14/07/2018
Well made cute top,"So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho",5,03/02/2018
Cute but not for me,"Beautiful in white, and beautiful to look at, but as the other reviewer mentioned, the fabric is very sheer and see thru. not a deal breaker if worn over a cami; however, the reason i am returning it is the fit. there is too much fabric flaring right at my waist. it looks like a tent on me. in addition, some of the beading is already coming off, and i can't imagine what it will look like after one wash. that's too bad, but i can't justify paying this much money for a sweet top that is beautiful",4,15/03/2018
Shirt looks better than in the photo,I am not a big fan of lace but this shirt has just enough. it actually looks better than the photo and it looks even better when you wear it. i have received numerous compliments on this shirt everytime i've worn it.,4,05/04/2018
Very detail lace and beading design. comfortable!,"I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores, but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on",5,27/04/2018
Very short shirt - gorgeous for shorter folks!,"I loved this shirt online and went to my local retailer store the other day and wanted to try it on. i didn't even get past the ""hold it up and measure the length"" test we tall people often do, as it was incredibly short. there is no way i could wear this shirt at 5'11"". 

unless you have a short torso and want to rock the (icky) high-waisted pants that are everywhere right now, this beautiful top might not work for you.

oh, and it's sheer. camisole needed for white and navy.",4,24/03/2018
Chambray top,"I just received the top today, and will send back for a larger size. i am i between a 4 and 6, so tried the 4 thinking it would be boxy. it is very fitted with no opening to assist in pulling over shoulders. i am hoping the 6 is only slightly bigger. the shirt also had a slight musty odor. it's a rather thin chambray....with 3/4 sleeves. the top came to just the top of my jeans, which should work for higher waisted skirts or layering.",4,18/02/2018
Great top,I love the ease of wearing and styling this top. i am very pleased with the construction. glad i ordered it!,5,22/02/2018
Love!,"This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!",5,16/09/2018
Wide ruffled pinstripe buttondown,"I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have",5,13/06/2018
Short top,"This looks really cute online. i was super excited to get it and i ordered my regular size in maeve. i got a size 0 (i am 5'4, 114#). the top is very pretty and the fabric is nice but it is very short, it didn't even cover my stomach and didn't come to the top of my jeans. i'm sending it back. maeve usually runs big but you can't tell from the photo and the size chart that it's more of a crop top. disappointing since almost every size is sold out.",4,13/02/2018
Elegant and feminine,"This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant, and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.",5,15/07/2018
Almost,"Beautiful top, the silk was good quality, not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly, wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.",3,05/12/2018
Nice white tunic,This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.,3,14/11/2018
Cute,"This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses",4,16/07/2018
"Runs large, bohemian","I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)

cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.

color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.

ruffle is a great addition too...",5,14/05/2018
Light & large,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",2,28/01/2018
Pretty but runs large!,"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.",5,11/04/2018
Very cute top,"I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top",5,27/07/2018
Runs big!,"Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it's so soft. doesn't wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i'm usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down!",4,15/08/2018
Stylish and understated elegant,"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w",5,26/09/2018
Fits like a maternity top,"Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that.",3,04/07/2018
Adorable and flattering,This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.,5,16/05/2018
Odd fit,"I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off. it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too. this one was just too much material. i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me. i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in, but decided in the end to return because i just didn't love it. the pink color and the fabric are nice,  though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a 3.",2,17/03/2018
So cute for summer!,"Although this is an online only, i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store. this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo. it doesn't show as much in the model photos, but this top has a subtle high-low effect, which adds a bit of elegance to the top.

i took my usual size xs in the tyhlo brand. however, note that i am small busted (~34b/c) and this was already starting to pull some across the chest. my biggest critique it that this pulling caused a small ga",5,26/03/2018
"Thin, shapeless","I was expecting a lot more, but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose, just too loose, as it runs very very large i returned it",2,09/05/2018
New favorite peasant blouse!,"I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei",5,17/08/2018
Very boxy,This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,1,21/05/2018
On its way back to retailer,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,1,15/05/2018
"Scratchy material, plaid doesn't align","I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size. 

the material is so rough, scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100, i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous, matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the",1,14/08/2018
Runs big,"This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost, so i'd definitely wear a tank under.",2,08/08/2018
"Runs big, order one size down",I bought a similar top by same manufacturer in fall in xs. this time it ran huge and had to order xxs which fit fine. it's very cute on.,4,26/08/2018
Flowy and fun.,"This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!",5,12/03/2018
Surprisingly lovely,"I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.",5,01/02/2018
Gorgeous!,"I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady, with a bit extra around the middle, this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!",5,27/10/2018
"Prettier in person, runs a bit small",I ordered the xl in the green motif. the shirt is fitted through the body. i'm a pear-shape so it's tight around my hips. it's cut straight down. i'll need to wear this tucked in or belt it/pull it up a bit closer to my waistline so it's more comfortable. the colors & pattern in the green motif are prettier in person. i love orange roses & haven't found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it. i used my birthday discount to splurge on this. i think it's over-priced for what it i,4,19/08/2018
Runs large,"The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle, then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality, but not practical.",1,03/08/2018
Great item!,"This tunic is flattering and high quality, just be sure you size down!",5,16/08/2018
"Nice top, but large","I wanted to love this top, but similar to many of retailer's styles (especially this season), this top is very large and tent-like. normally i like a larger top, but i was not expecting the length of this top. it might be cute belted if that is your style, but still much more like of a tunic than a top - could also make a nice maternity top. i am 5'7"" and ordered a medium and this top hit me much lower than pictured on the model. the fabric and pattern, as well as the neckline are very nice",4,07/04/2018
Nice top,No complaints about this top. i like that it's very soft and the length is good as a tunic. would recommend.,4,02/06/2018
Sweet tunic,"Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.",5,03/08/2018
Love!!!,"Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.",5,14/08/2018
Cute...on someone else,This top is very cute...on other people. i ordered my normal size (xs) and just did not work out. it's very billowy on the bottom (too much for me) and the top portion did not lay right. the material is thin so you will need to wear a cami underneath it. perhaps if i got the petite xs that right have been a better fit...not sure. in the end the top went back.,4,21/05/2018
Perfect seasonal transition top,"I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,",5,08/04/2018
Simply adorable!,This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!,5,30/09/2018
Cute!,"The shirt is a very cute cut. it ""poofed"" out a little more than i thought and kind of looked like a tutu. but, i wore it with white jeans to work and got a lot of compliments!",4,22/01/2018
"Wide, not as expected, or pictured","Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",1,18/04/2018
So sad to send it back but...,"Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large, but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far, i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos, the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he",3,29/05/2018

Comfortable,"A nice rayon peasant shirt - like the sleeve length. good for a fuller figure, covers all the bad sports and very comfortable.",5,04/10/2018
Purple motif,"I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif, although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer, although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics, but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small, and the sleeves hit at wrist bone",5,21/08/2018
"Pretty, but try on before you buy!","This shirt is much more flattering in person. if i hadn't seen it in store, i don't think it would have caught my eye. i like the mix of casual and dressy this top has (i got it specifically for teaching). the one thing i noticed, however, was that the first xs i tried on looked very big on me. i tried a second on and the fit was much more flattering! i highly recommend that you try on the specific blouse you plan to purchase before you actually buy it. i'm glad i tried a second on, because i th",4,22/05/2018

Adorable but poor fit,"I really wanted to love this, but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref, i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area, but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back, but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look",3,04/10/2018
Lovely lightweight button-up,"This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest, size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however, my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on",5,07/04/2018
"Great, but size down.","I ordered this top in the solid navy. the quality seemed very good, and my overall impression was favorable. what i liked was that the top stayed off the shoulders even when i was moving. so many of the on-trend ""cold shoulder"" tops simply do not stay put with even the slightest movement. unfortunately, this top ran quite a bit large. if you are in between sizes - i definitely recommend sizing down. i've not seen the printed floral option, but the dark navy is lovely and looks chic with white bo",4,22/03/2018
This top runs very large,"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner.",3,21/08/2018
Does not fit as expected,"Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite, way too much fabric. returned.",2,05/11/2018

"Beautiful top, worth the necessary tailoring","The beautiful bold print drew me to this top and it did not disappoint upon receipt. however, the bottom ruffle belled so far out on each side that it was laughable! the actual fit is nothing like the picture; clearly the model's arms are placed in front of all the extra fabric to hold the ruffle back.
however, the fabric is beautiful, the fit was perfect (size 2, 5'4"", 106 lbs.), the quality is great and i love the print so i decided to take it to my tailor to ""sew away"" the ""wings"" on both si",4,14/04/2018

Just doesn't fit right,"I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2"", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!",1,14/09/2018
Pretty,"Quite cute, it feels good on. the fit is tts and the colors are bright and just as depicted. i am a medium in most of retailer clothes and this fit nicely.",4,09/03/2018
Okay but not at this price,"I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.
pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it's a very pretty top.
cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly",2,29/05/2018

I love this top,"This is even nicer in person than it is online. i absolutely love it. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered my usual size small. i probably could have worn an extra small, but don't feel like the small is too big. this could be my favorite purchase of the season.",5,08/09/2018
Itchy itchy itchy!,"Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2"" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy.",2,06/10/2018
Dissappointed in this blouse,"When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau",2,21/08/2018
Not for larger chests,"I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.

when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27"" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10""), hitting well above my hip bones.

This blouse has lovely features,"The blouse is lightweight and is double layered, meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1, a bit busty, and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.",5,17/09/2018
Cute and versatile top,"As soon as i saw this blouse in the store, i fell in love with it. i thought it was a little too expensive for what it was, but, hey, that's antho for you. i luckily had a gift card and a 15% off bday promo, so i got it at a good discount. i love the fit of it. sometimes button-down tops like this are too tight in the arms or pulls too much around the chest, and this one doesn't. when i do wear it, i have to be conscious of the buttons because it can be a little gappy in between the buttons when",4,26/08/2018
Cute,"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)",5,29/05/2018
Dry clean only!,"I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top. 

i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.",3,28/08/2018
Love it!,"Ok, so the shirt is ""dry clean only"", however, i like it so much that i'm not going to knock out a star in the rating. the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me ------ i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed. i'm 5'6"", 36c and 125 lbs, and the size 6 was perfect. wonderful for work and also great with jeans. i know it's a little pricy, but it's cute and unique --- plus right now it's 25% cheaper.",5,02/12/2018
Summer plaid,"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",5,08/11/2018

Super cute,"I have worn this with skinny jeans and espadrilles untucked and with black linen shorts. i also wore tucked in with high waisted slim fit black pants,

( i am curvy on bottom and have a long torso) for the price, it did not justify a place in my closet?",3,11/07/2018
Nice top but fabric not that good,"This top is very nice. i ordered it in black, it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric, however, feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable, it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton, i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.",3,05/09/2018

Alpinia top,"I really love the top but fyi it's really an open front vest and the under tank doesn't come with it. it's nice because you can mix it up with different colors underneath, but i think they should have noted that fact in case you weren't prepared to receive half of what you thought you were purchasing.",4,24/06/2018
Adorable,"This is a really cute top. it's boxy but it's cotton eyelet so you shouldn't expect form fitting. if you are in between sizes order a size down. i'm a 36 ddd and usually have to wear large with retailer brands, however, the medium fit fine, it doesn't pull in the back or shoulders. the cotton material is thick enough that you don't have to wear a cami underneath if you don't want to. it's also long enough that your stomach won't show through the bottom eyelet band.",4,27/07/2018
Baggy and shapeless,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those, ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful",3,30/08/2018
"Huge, long and baggy","This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down, because of the eyelet and the cute hem, it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.",2,03/04/2018
Go to summer tank,"This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans, culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators, summer booties, and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not",5,23/10/2018

Does not have a straight line fit,"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.",2,03/10/2018
Nice too but not what you expect from photo,I ordered my usual size and i think the length and the top (chest/arms) for great. however the bottom is more of a swing style than a straight or slight a-line as depicted in the stock photo. there is too much fabric in the stomach area and just not flattering.,3,28/01/2018
Easy summer top,I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.,5,14/04/2018
"Beautiful top, just not perfect","I got my usual xs (i'm a 32b) and the top fit fine from the chest up. my head just fits through the hole on top without having to unbutton. but then from the chest down, the shirt billows out too far. it hits me at the hip like the model (i'm 5'6"" and wear 2/26) but because of the extra fabric it really needs to be longer to balance out the trapeze look. since the top portion fits nicely i almost want to keep it then have a seamstress take it in a little at the waist so it's more a-line than tra",3,22/05/2018

the bad:
when i tried it on, i found the bust to be too small, and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also, the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.

Lovely printed blouse,I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,5,03/06/2018
A standout,"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b",5,07/07/2018
Disappointing!,"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",2,06/05/2018

Not a good fit,"This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.",1,05/10/2018

Boho chic at it's finest!,I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.,5,23/02/2018
Amazing,"Ordered this on a whim, in my normal size large, and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft, fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.",5,24/01/2018
Breezy,Love this top-that simple,5,06/08/2018
Short and scratchy,"This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition, it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning, but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad, because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material, you'll be fine buying t",3,11/03/2018
Gorgeous!,Love this top! runs true to size. exactly as pictured.,5,11/05/2018
Cute but...,"I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back, however, the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front, but i was really wanting the back to lo",3,13/04/2018
"Cute design, poor quality","For starters, the back pictured on the website is not true to the actual back of the shirt. the small traps are not there and it isn't gathered in the exact same way. the big bow is adjustable and overall i really loved the fit of the top, but the difference in design is not something i would expect from retailer. my shirt also got a hole in it along the seam in the back after washing once. although i liked the look of the top, the quality is not what i'm used to from retailer.",3,15/11/2018
Cute but,"It was a little on the thinner side (fabric), a little more sheer that i would have liked. i actually prefer that it doesn't have the straps in the back, i didn't order it before until i read the reviews. fit loosely. the shirt is comfortable, and the back is beautiful (love bows), tbu the front was just ordinary. for the price, even on sale, i didn't feel i absolutely needed it, but if you are looking for a hite tank, it is pretty cute. (ivory, not pure white).

xs: 115 lbs, 60 dd.",4,29/09/2018
What a disappointment,"I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o",1,06/07/2018
Nice top,"Like the other reviewers experienced, i received my top in the mail, and it does not have the straps as shown in the online pictures. not to say that the top is not attractive, though, and i'll be keeping it. very comfortable and cool in the triple-digit heat in my community.",4,07/11/2018
"Beautiful top, but very thin","This top has a beautiful pattern, and the color is gorgeous - just like the photo. it is very thin, but under a sweater or blazer in the fall/winter would be perfect. it is a little big! i would order a size down.",4,20/05/2018
"Nice style, but had some issues...","I love the contemporary style of this piece, but i returned it because the side slits were too high even for a short person like me (5'1""). but if you don't mind showing a little skin at the waist when you raise your arms, it might work for you. the fabric has a nice texture and the muted colors would mix well with other pieces.",4,22/03/2018
Didn't work,"This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.",2,04/09/2018
Better on the hanger,"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",1,17/09/2018
This is a lovely top when sized correctly.,"I am a small, athletic build and typically wear an xsmall in tops. naturally, in something with a more straight fit and blousy shape, an xsmall would be appropriate. i ordered it and was super bummed. the lace detail made the collar lay funny and the shoulders were too tight. i liked the sheer fabric though and the lace details and decided to order a size up. i am so glad i did because everything laid like it was supposed to. this top is beautiful with a sexy, but refined look. i plan to dress i",4,05/02/2018
"Cute, but massive sweep","This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42"" and sweep is over 70"". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i'm thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style.",4,08/11/2018
Very very cute but a lot of fabric,"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs",5,31/10/2018
Huge,"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",2,09/06/2018
You'll smile on a humid summer's day,"This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy",5,02/12/2018
Crisp and clean,Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!,5,22/02/2018
Amazing addition to my summer wardrobe,I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!,5,04/04/2018
Flattering shirt,This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!,5,20/10/2018
"Cute, crisp shirt","If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. 

fits nicely! i'm 5'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. 

the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting.",4,08/02/2018
Versatile,"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!",5,16/02/2018
Boxy,"I try to find something to like about everything i buy, even if it turns out to be a disappointment. for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering. it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt, but unfortunately it was not enough. this shirt is super boxy and runs large. i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this. if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons won't pull at the ch",2,27/11/2018
Exceeded expectations,Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste. found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well. love how the flutter layer creates a different look.,5,10/07/2018
Runs small,"This is a well made and nice looking top.the gathering around the neck adds to the overall look of the shirt, but it also affects the way it fits. i got my usual size medium and it was tight in the shoulders and arm holes. i regret that i had to send it back.",4,05/02/2018
Very pretty but very small,"This top is very pretty and looks so good with the blue flower skirt. unfortunately it runs very small. it fit my bust but would not go down. i imagine it would look better on a much slender frame, but since it fit my bust i wonder if the armholes are too big or it maybe a bit loose at the top. i like the style and design a lot, very dressy, but the buttons at the top are a bit hard to put on and remove. since this is turtleneck, every time you wear it the buttons have to come on and off. the bu",4,24/09/2018
Beautiful design,"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi",5,01/09/2018
Zipper broke,"The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it's come to that.",2,19/09/2018
Neutral blue,"I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-) 
te blue is a light blue, almost neutral, with the white embroidery, i think it looked stylish, and decided to keep it. the peplum part hit just in the right spot, i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size...",4,10/08/2018
"Beautifully made, but not versatile","This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was. i love the shape, design, and and the color. it's perfect for spring and summer with some white pants. unfortunately, i don't see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way. so far, it doesn't work with any of my jeans, skirts, or shorts. i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits, so i'm still on the fence if i'm going to keep it or not. with that aside, it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful",4,02/04/2018
Awkward fitting,"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",2,08/08/2018
"Very pretty, boho chic","I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction.",5,01/11/2018
Great too but not for women who have a large bust.,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did,3,28/05/2018
Pretty blouse,"This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.
it looks and feels like really good quality.",5,10/10/2018
Gorgeous top with a hint of pizazz,I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.,5,26/02/2018
Pretty adn flattering,"I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...",5,12/03/2018
Manette clipdot blouse,"I agree that this blouse is boxy, but because it's not too long in length it evens it out. any longer or shorter would make it look too boxy. it's great for work to dinner during the week & goes great with jeans too.",4,16/06/2018
So pretty and great style,I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!,5,06/10/2018
Pretty spring flowers,"This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.",5,08/11/2018
Boxy,Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.,3,01/07/2018
Nice but short,"I really like the style of this top, and it's delicate but well made, but i wish it were longer and less boxy. it's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer, but the cami is very cropped. when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff (and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary). a longer cami probably wouldn't work because the top is also very short. i'm 5'0'' with an average torso length, and ordered the xxs petite. also, you would have to cut the tag off if you d",3,28/09/2018
Pretty top for work days,"This is a pretty top that is conservative enough for the office, with a modest neckline. there is a little hidden snap or button under the bow at the neck so you don't have to keep fussing with the tie the fit is loose in the waist and high at the neck, so the sheer parts are the only thing to give it a little flirtiness. there is a matching camisole underneath that snaps in at the shoulders. overall, i thought it was nice when i tried it at the store, but it didn't have enough extra ""wow"" to ge",4,12/10/2018
"Feminine, flattering, versatile","The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou",5,26/06/2018
Awesome top,"Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!",5,23/08/2018
"Gorgeous, flattering blouse!","This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!",5,24/08/2018
Manette clipdot blouse,"I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately, this top doesn't suit my long, slim midsection. it is so wide, it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.",3,30/04/2018
Beautiful blouse; very flattering,"Overall, gorgeous blouse; very flattering. i love the sleeves; very unique and also flattering. i love how the blouse is a fit-and-flare from the bust. it's fitted at the bust (but not tight) and drapes with an a-line style. the fit of this blouse is truly flattering to the figure. no issues with inappropriate amounts of cleavage showing or anything. the ties are weighted on the end with metal tubes, which i really like because it makes the strings drape nicely. the back drapes beautifully. i fe",4,22/10/2018

"Love, love, love this tunic!","Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.",5,03/06/2018
Perfect top!,This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!,5,16/02/2018
Perfect balance of classy and sexy,I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.,5,25/01/2018
Great top,This top is great for spring- it's super light and can be dressed up or down depending on what you're wearing it for. fits true to size and is great quality.,4,21/03/2018

Good basic - but sheer,"I loved this in the store, but had to order my size. it is true to size - a great length - but the material is very thin and very sheer. i don't think it will carry over into fall - it is more of a summer weight fabric. it is also a little pricey for that same reason - still - its a great basic and i will keep my eye out for it to go on sale.",4,11/10/2018

Flattering,I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!,5,22/11/2018
Bought in 2 patterns!,"This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!",5,18/09/2018
Not flattering,I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.,3,19/07/2018
Go to summer top!,This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.,5,16/04/2018

"Flattering, comfy top","Everyone has said it, so i'll just add my two cents - this is a great, soft, flattering top. i bought two, one in white and one in black, and i have never worn them without getting compliments. i sometimes wear them buttoned up, and sometimes completely unbuttoned to expose tanks or bathing suits.

Wanted to love...,"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",2,04/09/2018

Perfect for summer,"I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh",5,23/06/2018

Cute and comfy!,"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!",5,01/06/2018
Great quality!,Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!,5,05/11/2018
Pretty top poor fit,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large, xs fit however wasn't flattering",3,14/10/2018
Avoid if you're curvy...,"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass.",2,12/05/2018
Fun top for all seasons,"I am so happy i purchased this top in 2 colors while it was on sale. i have the navy/white pattern and the green. both are vibrant and fun. i'm 8 months pregnant and these fit me currently. i can see them being a great top for post baby and on as well. i'll probably layer this in the fall and winter with a chambray jacket or a loose knit sweater. my only complaint (which is why i gave 4 stars) the top button comes undone very easily. it also pulls a bit at the top 2 buttons, but i may be able to",4,12/09/2018
Very flattering and comfy,"I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!",5,24/11/2018
Blouse,"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product",5,28/10/2018
Beautiful,"Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!",5,05/02/2018
Awful fit,Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.,2,23/06/2018
Versatile blouse!,"Agree with other contributer - this is a great piece to snag on sale. i bought this 2 months post partum with the intention of hiding the post baby belly - which is does well! i think it fits true to size (i'm typically l and this l fit well). i can see how certain body types it would look maternity, but i'm short and curvy and the blouse is flattering. it's lightweight, so i plan to add a cardigan in the fall/winter.",4,25/08/2018
"Cute, but not on me!","I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",2,18/11/2018
Adorable top,"This is a cute top, especially the material design. i like tops that go over my bottom and this does. if i had a problem it is with the sizing. the fact that it was only online so i could not try it on made it difficult to know really what size to get. some reviews said it was true to size and others said go down a size. i did go down a size but it still hangs a little big. but i still love the overall look. i am also petite which is what i ordered.",4,15/03/2018
Wanted to love,"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",2,23/08/2018
Cute top!,"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!",5,01/04/2018
Fits like maternity,"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",2,20/11/2018
Love the color,"The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!",5,22/10/2018
Pretty details,I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.,5,24/01/2018
"Love the way it looks, but couldn't keep it",I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.,2,07/09/2018
Beautiful winter color,"Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well",5,02/04/2018
Very delicate,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,1,19/02/2018
Too delicate,"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.",1,05/03/2018
Star print is so pretty!,"I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!",5,26/02/2018
Beautiful feminine blouse,"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2"" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.",5,18/10/2018
I wear my sunglasses,"I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th",5,17/04/2018
Dress up or down,"This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.",5,12/10/2018
Great summer print,"Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.",5,27/05/2018
Best purchase anywhere lately!,"These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.",5,27/08/2018
Just as cute as expected,"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!",5,14/08/2018
So cute and unique!,"I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!",5,06/12/2018
Very flattering,"I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!",5,18/02/2018
Gorgeous top but very high-waisted,"I love everything about this blouse except for one thing: the peplum just hits way too high up on the body, and i am only 5'4"". 106 and ordered a regular size 2 (not petite) which fits perfectly except for this. it is made of a beautiful textured fabric and is very nice quality. i adore peplums and own many and like the peplum to begin near the waist. however, others may not mind the higher waist and in that case it may work for them. i really hated to send it back it was so pretty but it just w",4,31/07/2018
The most versatile top.,"I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u",5,10/02/2018
Love it!,"This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!",5,05/11/2018
"Great top, runs a little short","Love peplums and love this top! the quality and fabric is beautiful. i did have to size up because it ran a little too short on me, but otherwise great top. really cute to pair with a statement necklace as well!",4,24/01/2018
"Love, love, love","I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.",5,29/07/2018
"Lovely, but it is tight in the chest.","I have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small. i'm 5'8, an athletic pear with narrow shoulders, 34c, and usually a 6 in tops at retailer. since the top looks a little short on the model, i sized up to an 8, since i'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer. i'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip, and if it were any smaller, it'd be too tight in my chest. since it doesn't stretch, you need some space for your arms to move. if i could do it again, i'd actually si",4,08/03/2018
Love it,"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great",5,04/11/2018
Too much pep in this peplum...,"I love a good peplum top, and was so excited when it arrived, but was sad to find the flare on the peplum was a little too much. i'm not sure why it was so unflattering, because in every other way, it fit like a dream, but it seemed like either there was too much or too little fabric around the waist to have it hang properly. it had to go back.",3,13/02/2018
Unique and beautiful,This top is beautiful. so beautiful that i am keeping it even though it is a little bit large and drapey. the fabric has a golden glow to it. the details in the back are darling. perfect for a romantic dinner out.,4,28/04/2018
Gorgeous and unique,"This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room, or i would not have seen it. i tried it on, and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big, and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago, when just about everything in the store was truly unique.",5,17/08/2018
Amazing vintage top,"I just purchased this velvet top in my regular size small (34-27-35) so i'd say it runs tts and i couldn't be happier! the designer, moulinette soeurs is one of my very favorites here at retailer and always seems to come through for me when i need something really special. it's is a vintage style top that reminds me of something miss fisher from ""miss fisher's murder mysteries,"" the ""downton abbey"" ladies or the designer sisters from ""the house of eliott"" would wear and that's a major compliment.",5,17/02/2018
Such a unique piece!,"Retailer is known for their unique designs and this one does not fail to disappoint. i usually wait for items to go on sale but knew i had to have this one in my collection due to the fact that it can easily be worn with a pair of pants. the actual shirt is a bit shimmery which you can't tell by looking at the photo. i didn't mind it and thought it was actually a plus! i just think it is a bit too expensive, because although it is nice quality, i don't feel it is worth the price tag. pretty",4,17/10/2018
Too shimmery,"While this top has a lovely design, neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.",3,17/05/2018
Lovely colors but boxy,"I had the priviledge of trying this on during the 20% off tops sale, too bad but the store only had regualr sizes, and xs was the smallest. i am not super tiny (read have muscles), but this looked huge on me. love the colros and textures though, the line in the back is pretty and adds charm when you turn around, and the combo of all the colros is awesome, but i would need a xxs or perhaps a petite (though it is short, so not sure about petite)... soft, but try a smaller size...",4,20/09/2018
Gorgeous arts and crafts aesthetic,"I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.",5,26/07/2018
Stunning top,"This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft), the flowers, the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!",5,30/11/2018
Greatest party top,"I have never written a review on retailer before, but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online, i felt i had a duty to review it. it is gorgeous! i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it. the fabric is light pink with a shimmer. the flower detailing is so feminine and soft. the back's closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing. i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be",5,04/08/2018
Exquisite!,"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!",5,11/08/2018
Retro chambray shirt,The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.,5,29/09/2018
Pretty top,"This is a nice light weight cotton i purchased for work.. i usually take a size 4 or 6. i bought it online and opted for a size 6. i will be exchanging this for the smaller size, as it is a bit boxy and the sleeve length is ample. once the exchange is done i look forward to having this blouse that i can wear untucked and still not be wearing yet another tunic (my go to style).",4,02/06/2018
Not great,"I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.",2,14/08/2018
Nice detail,"I purchased the mustard colored item and it is very good for spring. nice fit, nice quality",4,25/02/2018
Feminine blouse for summer,"Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want.  like the laser cut detail front and back.  sleeveless is great for summer months here.  can wear to work or dress down with jeans.  fit is true to size.  i am 5'5"", slim and small busted so anything fits me.  i would think it you're busty it would be fine as it's a blousy fit.
the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me.  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work.",5,02/11/2018
Perfect fit on me!,"I ordered this in an 8p yellow. the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping it'd be, but i'm keeping it because it fits me perfectly. i am chesty for my size (32ddd), and somehow i don't look bigger than i am in this top. i also have broad shoulders and this doesn't feel tight when i move my arms. bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place! i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f",5,10/02/2018
Terrible quality of material,"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",1,29/03/2018
Very cute,"The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!",5,16/11/2018
Pretty and sophisticated,"This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light, but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.
i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo",5,22/05/2018
Navy top is classic and timeless,"I was looking for a navy top to replace an overused navy silk cowlneck that i have been wearing for years. this is perfect. light, versatile and classic.",4,02/08/2018
Cute but a little awkward.,"I adore this blouse, but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.",3,02/04/2018
"Versatile, great spring color","I ordered a size 4, my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops, i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4"" 120 lbs,, 32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath, which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work.",5,03/02/2018
Simple and elegant,"I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. 
other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.",5,03/02/2018
Pink is brighter,"Just note the pink is different than in the photos. much hotter/more saturated. apart from that surprise, overall i'd recommend. nice design.",4,29/04/2018
Lacy cutouts/ flattering shape/ versatile,"I ordered this lovely blouse the moment i saw it, and i am very pleased that it is the quality and fit i'd hoped for. i bought the medium in pink. i am 130#, 34f, size 8 or medium on most tops. the medium fits me perfectly; i love the gathering at top back so that there is no pulling at all across the back or bust. i am mystified that all blouses aren't designed with a nice level of gathering to accommodate a bust and to give a flattering flow.. i am busty so awkward tightness can be a problem o",5,08/09/2018
Perfect blouse......,"I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me.
the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in, so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6, but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow, but not overly so, so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything, for many seasons. love the quality.",5,09/06/2018
Makes you feel like a million bucks,"I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows, but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing, and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them, i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel",5,07/03/2018
Lovely top,"I bought this top as it is perfect for work under a blazer! the patten is pretty and eye catching, i love that it's 100% silk and has the tie in front so it's not too low for work. so chic and sophisticated!",5,31/08/2018
"Flattering, flows out","This top isn't straight as it would seem on the ""tucked-in"" picture on the model. colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson. fabric si very soft. i tried on the 0 but am wondering about trying on 00 or petite size...which i would have to order, so will wait a bit on this one.",5,23/09/2018
Must see this beautiful blouse,"I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked, it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels, or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide",5,27/08/2018
Versatile and elegant,"I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget, and i couldn't resist taking it home. the photo doesn't do the textured sheen of the silk justice--the metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant, but still subtle. my husband (who usually hates anything with a bow) loves this, though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model. go one size down--i usually wear a 14 in blouses but took a 12 in this.",5,27/03/2018
Gorgeous,The picture doesn't do this justice. this top is amazing in person. i purchased my regular size 2. it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material. worth the money,5,30/07/2018
Beautiful,"This is a gorgeous blouse!  the quality is exceptional- beautiful, soft silk. the pattern is lovely, the shape and design is spot on!!  finally!  a lovely tie neck blouse that fits well and is made well. i'm a busty mama and my the size 2 fits perfectly. thank you retailerpolgie for a gorgeous piece of clothing!",5,09/07/2018

Great casual top for jeans,"I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.",5,03/12/2018
Beautiful details,The embroidery details on this top are beautiful. the material is soft and a really good quality. my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments! i love it!,5,17/04/2018
Not like the picture,"Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the ""boho peasant"" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected) , she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off.
disappointing as picture makes it much prettier.",3,26/06/2018

Gorgeous embroidery,"I absolutely love this shirt! i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it. all they had in stock was a size 2 and a size 8. i'm usually a 4-6 in button-up shirts, but i tried the 2 anyway and found it to be quite generously sized. i have a 32dd bust, so button-up shirts rarely fit me properly. this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in, and was loose-fitting without being sloppy. when i discovered that it came in petite sizes, i asked the so to order t",5,30/08/2018

Summer beauty,"This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.",5,22/11/2018
Beautiful summer shirt; runs very large,"The embroidery is gorgeous! it's a lovely blouse--soft, lightweight, and of quality material. the only problem is that it is an oversized fit--running at least one or two sizes too large. it is enormous! i ordered it online but will return it and shop for a much smaller size in the store to guarantee proper fit.",4,24/01/2018
Love it!,"This is a lovely and unique blouse. it can be worn with jeans, shorts or a skirt. such a beautiful addition to anyone's wardrobe!",5,24/10/2018
Pretty hot mess,This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,2,15/04/2018
Beautiful top,"Plan to wear this with pants. may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling, but i recommend trying on before deciding. truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light. would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight, but still not a bad value.",5,14/10/2018
Flattering fit,"I loved this top! the cinched in waist is so flattering. or i'll leave it un-cinched for a super relaxed fit. it's comfortable and light weight so i'll be wearing this into late spring/ early summer. i've worn it with the green pilcro slim pants, i've worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress, i've worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach. i can't wait to find more fun ways to wear it!",5,17/07/2018
Cute lightweight tunic,"I wear stuff like this a lot so naturally i got this one. i love it and i think it's flattering however it wrinkles easily and also when i hand washed in cold water it shrunk a little which super irritating, but i'm going to wear it anyway. i think it can be worn with many things so it'll stay in rotation a while.",4,02/06/2018
Comfortable style,"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",5,07/04/2018
Classic and easy,"I purchased this shirt in black. luckily, it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.",5,30/11/2018
Went back for more,"I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.",5,04/07/2018
I love this top--fits like a dream!,"I bought this top in black, and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me, but this top is definitely a great length.",5,12/06/2018
Missing drawstring!,"This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back.",2,09/02/2018
Beautiful design,"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger",3,03/08/2018
Short but wide,"This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.",2,04/03/2018
Beautiful and soft,"This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely, i don't have petite to compare, or 00, but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)

115 lbs for reference...",5,04/02/2018
Unique back,"I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it, and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear, but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking, i am able to wear my regular bra under it, and the straps don't hang out.",5,07/07/2018
Beautiful fabric and design,"I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.",5,31/10/2018
Beautiful collage of colors,I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.,5,05/06/2018
Even more lovely in person!,"I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!",5,11/11/2018
Lovely and unusual,"This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf",5,27/05/2018
Great material,"Love it. got a lot of compliments with it.
buy it, it's worth it especially with the sale price right now.",5,12/06/2018
Simple structured classic,"Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good, will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.",4,19/08/2018
Elegant,"I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.",5,19/10/2018
Great basic tank,I'm always on the hunt for good white blouses to pair with business casual attire or everyday wear. this was a great tank. i love the fabric. it's nice and sturdy and you don't have to worry about wearing a cami beneath it. this fabric does wrinkle some so bear that in mind. i really like the shape of the top near the shoulders. it's a great conservative cut. the little criss cross detail on the back adds a bit of charm to the top. i would definitely recommend this to others.,4,22/03/2018
Super cute but embroidery is stiff,"Tried on standard xs and the photo on-line is slightly misleading as i thought that there were more colors involved in the embroidery pattern. in person, the pattern is not as intricate with only 2 solid colors. the body of the shirt is light, airy/billowy, not as form grazing like on the model..which i don't mind. i still love the top but would have to go for a petite xs or even a petite xxs so that it would be a little more fitted all around. note that the embroidery on the dã©colletã© feels lik",4,26/11/2018
Light and lovely but not for me,"This is a well-made top and looks very pretty in the pictures, but in person it has a little more of a gauzy look to it. it is a great summer shirt as it is light and airy, but unfortunately it didn't work for me. i wear a 34c and that often results in shirts look more like tents or maternity wear than anything else. so, perhaps this works better for the smaller chested. additionally, and this wasn't so much of a con and just something to note, the fabric is pretty see-through. it works for the",3,22/04/2018
Wide cut,"Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back.",2,10/08/2018
Very cute and flattering,The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!,5,22/01/2018
Beautiful but very fragile,"In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un",5,10/06/2018
Statement top!,"I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors! this top is perfect for our florida 90 degree weather! i am usually a medium in tops (size 6-8), broad shoulders, size 36c and i purchased this in a 6p and a 6 (as they were out of petite in turquoise). i do prefer the 6p as i am 5'2"". i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move. i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit, but they are almost covered by the s",5,10/07/2018
Perfect summer top,Loved this online and it did not disappoint. lightweight and super flattering. fabric is sheer with a lovely windowpane pattern. top front of the bodice is lined. looks great with a pair of jeans. super easy to care for. toss in washer in a mesh bag and it comes our perfectly. will likely be a go-to summer piece.,4,09/06/2018
Go up a size if you are busty!,"Love this top. very flattering on an hour glass figure because even though it has a more of an empire waist it is not so volumous as to overwhelm the figure --as so many retailer tops are these days. one caution: i had to go up a size to accommodate my bust.  normally a size 6 or small in retailer tops but a 34dd, so went up to a size 8.  the top is more snug around the bustline so just be warned if you are well endowed.  
the fabric is sheer but not overly so, embroidery is well done. over all a b",4,19/08/2018
Patchwork denim tank,"I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time, so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door, however, this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut, but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.",2,18/02/2018
Perfect summer blouse,This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 12 in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to,5,31/10/2018
Perfect fit and style for work or casual,"I get nervous shopping online, but this top fit perfectly - wasn't too long or too short. it has nice flow and dresses up or down depending on the look you're going for. i got the off-white with blue polka-dots and love it!",5,20/08/2018
Super sweet feminine top,"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange, not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time.",5,01/09/2018
Too short!,"This is such a cute design, but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big, it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.",3,11/08/2018
So pretty!,"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color, very feminine without being over the top.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there, making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place, although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly",5,18/11/2018
Beware of color,"I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse, the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version, be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!",3,23/01/2018
So pretty in red,"I love this in the red motif....looks great with jeans or white. for maeve, this runs a little larger. at 5'8"" 130 lbs, i typically need a 6 to keep the front from pulling/gaping. the 6 in this was roomy and the 4 was also good. took the 6 for a little extra length. the shirt hits be about like the model in length, and while a little cropped, it won't show your stomach.",4,29/07/2018
Just sew the gap,"Being a 34d, i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read. they're right - it totally gaps even when standing still. so i took it to the tailor. they sewed the seam between the top two buttons. easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works. the color is great (i got the red one) and i like the fabric. i didn't think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam. looks great with skinny white jeans.",5,30/05/2018
Beautiful swing top,"I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print, but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on, however, i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin, young girls, but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats, the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore",5,22/03/2018
"Perfect fit, cute for summer","I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it's just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!",5,16/05/2018
Great colour!,Looking forward to wearing this on a beach holiday !,4,05/11/2018
Sweet tank,"I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.",5,25/07/2018
Reallly cute,Loved this blouse but tried on size 8 (my size). waaaaaay too big. tried a 6 - still big - but the 4 was perfect. the only problem was that it did get a bit shorter in length but also ended up a little more fitted which i really liked.,4,21/07/2018
Great color!,"This shirt was exactly what i was looking for. it's fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing. some of retailer's shirts can have too much swing for me, but this is just right. the color is great too!",5,02/10/2018
Love the ikat print,"A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size 4 was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well, the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy, & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the 4 didn't). i went w/ the siz",5,13/11/2018
Cute summer tank!,"This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!",5,27/03/2018
Wrong button choice,I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,1,13/10/2018
The buttons are a project...,"For a blouse this beautiful and whimsical, i just can't understand why the little button loops would need to be constructed to maintain security on fort knox. i patiently worked my way through the gauntlet of them because i was determined to try it on, but ultimately, i can't see doing this again for a pricey top that shouldn't require hard labor to access. the fabric is perfect; a beautiful cotton lawn without any sheen, which really brings out the contrast of colors. it is slightly see through",4,14/10/2018
Lovely fabric & nicely tailored,"I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.",5,31/10/2018
"Beautiful, but can't be used.","This top is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is great, the cut is nice, etc... however, the buttons are too big for the button loops, which do not have any stretch. it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on. once i had it on, i left it unbuttoned. i returned it. (if you can't live without it, you could put smaller buttons on it.) too pricey for a non-functioning top. too bad.",2,12/07/2018
Lovely blouse,"I'm not really sure what the big to-do about the buttons is all about - i was able to slip the blouse on over my head without undoing any of them with no problems. yes the buttons are difficult, but unless you're breastfeeding, they shouldn't be a deal breaker! the blouse is exactly what i was expecting. so pretty, feminine and flattering. also, though it is a tiny bit sheer, i plan to wear it with a nude bra and no cami.",5,06/08/2018
Awsome,"Love this top.. very flattering and form figure.. i dont see the issue with the buttoms, has elastized back enough to pullover in and out. material is thin yes .. but not so see through. i'm so keeping this .",5,25/09/2018
Lovely and unique!,"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small",5,02/05/2018
Pretty!,Love! love! love this tunic! i was worried about getting the regular size because they don't have my size in petite anymore but im glad i took a chance getting the regular size. my daughter said its just perfect on me. very pretty!,5,28/03/2018
Fall perfection,"I fell in love with this tunic on instagram, and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned, the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images, and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish, but not at all over the top.

i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di",5,11/10/2018
Fun casual tunic,"So soft. a casual tunic, yet polished and interesting enough for work. darker blue than the photo, and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person.",5,22/01/2018
Cute but.....,There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.,3,09/02/2018
Certainly lovely,"A lovely, creatively designed tunic that just isn't for me.  the embroidery is certainly intricate and the chambray shirt has a wearable hand, but the combination on my body type didn't look quite right, probably because i am too top heavy and apple torsoed.  i think if i were more slender, the fit would look like a flattering dress.  i had purchased the size 10 and i am 36dd 140#.",4,28/08/2018

Island blue off the shoulder top,What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.,5,16/05/2018
Cute and nice colors,"I tried this one and actually liked it more on me when the shoulders were slightly covered, so i decided to leave it back as it would bug me eventually... but the style is very feminine and the colors are gorgeous... if you like off the shoulder look, i say definitely worth it. the fabric was soft enough too.

Beautiful top,I loved this top from first sight and finally bought it this week. i am usually a six or a small. the small was so tight on the top that the ruffle rolled up across my chest. i ended up with a medium.,4,19/07/2018
Wow,"I was looking for a cute going out top that was age-appropriate (40yo). i read other reviews that it ran large so i got xxs regular (xs not available) for reference, i am 5'2"" and 95 pounds but semi-broad in the shoulders.

i was wary of the poly fabric but it is surprisngly nice and drapes well- easy care for sure. doesn't look cheap at all. when worn on the shoulders, the elastic is tightish, but maybe i could have gone to xs if they had it but at least i know the xxs won't fall/slide.

"Wonderful top, very unique","Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is",5,21/07/2018
Perfect top,I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h,5,13/10/2018
Perfect summer top!,"I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!",5,15/05/2018
Makes me feel pretty,"I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly.",5,01/08/2018
Love love love,"Love, love, love this top. it is everything i hoped it would be. i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder. what made me fall in love were the colors. quality is excellent as usual. it is quite full in bodice, however it's only an xs. i do best with xxs tops.",4,25/06/2018
Gorgeous!!,"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",5,25/08/2018
Love it so much i bought it twice!,"It's embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i've misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i'll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i'm sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!

Islander top,"A little boxy. a little short in the waist. a little overpriced. but, the shoulder ruffle and the color are so flattering and in the mirror it just says summertime casual chic and cute.",4,08/07/2018
Love the turquoise graphic design,"I am usually a small sometimes medium. purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy. it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me.
confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool.
i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy",4,28/10/2018

Very cute!,I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!,5,29/01/2018
Great piece,"Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though!
if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!",3,04/11/2018
Tight armholes,"I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8, and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight, but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d",2,01/08/2018

Must have denim,"Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!",5,06/09/2018
Nice basic - for layering,"I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.",5,26/08/2018

Lovely drape in your regular size,"I originally purchased this in my usual retailer size 6 (vanity size lol), and was nervous that the neck would be tight, based on the other reviews. however, once i tried it on i realized that in my usual size the body was a little too wide and didn't create any shape. i ended up exchanging for and keeping a size 4 and it fits much better in the body and i did not have a problem with any tightness in the neck in either size. for reference i'm 5'7"", 36dd 135lbs.

i would say this items runs true",4,05/07/2018
Flattering denim,"I love the look of this top. my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful. they took it back at the store and sent out another one right away.
the style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellent.
love the back zipper as well.",5,05/06/2018
Stiff and sturdy,"I am not quite sure what to think about this top... color is nice, cut iis pretty but the material is denim denim....it would probably soften with wear but the deal breaker for me is that i have a vein in my neck that pops out like crazy when i wear the top. if i release the neck it goes back to normal. not that it is tight but apparently it blocks flow somehow. so i passed. 

i tried on regulat 0 and it was fine at 115 lbs. 30 dd chest",4,15/09/2018
Recommend but with a caveat...,"I tried the 4 and felt it ran a bit big, i'm 34a-28-26, 5'6"" about 130lbs and expected to take a 6. the 4 was ideal.
love the concept but thought the material was too stiff to be a 'swing' tank. the pleats in the back poke up when you move or bend as if you've got little horns coming out of your back. i think a chambray, like cloth and stone produces might have rendered this super cute design better (imo).
it has a trapeze shape, i wouldn't plan on tucking it in.
finally, you mightn't want to",4,03/06/2018
Summer chambray!,"I love this top!! i got lucky and found it returned at a store (always always check the ""found and collected racks ladies!) it was a 6 and i was a little worried it would be much to large, but it fit great! i like that i can wear something under it or on its own. i didn't fit it too short, but i'm a little under 5'7"" and roughly 127 lbs, 32/34a. highly recommend!",5,21/04/2018
Odd fit,"Based on previous reviews, i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay, the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall, i didn't find it flattering or anything special.",3,15/06/2018
"Great quality, high neck","A wonderfully heavy weight piece, opposed to all the swingy chambray of summer, this piece will transition wonderfully into fall. the only disadvantage is a relatively high neck, which looks lovely but can be a little restrictive at times. highly recommend!",4,09/05/2018
A really cute top,"I am normally an xs or s in tanks, so ordered the size 6. looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love that it's a cotton denim but it doesn't have any stretch. love the look & the fabric, but the neck area feels slightly restrictive in the front & i think it wld creep up & pull on me when wearing. fabric is slightly stiff & the flared bottom just sticks out. armholes do cover the bra & length hits at the top of the hips on me. going to return the 6, but will try the 8 if the local store has it.",4,07/02/2018
Love this!,This is a unique take on a denim shirt! i have about five other denim shirts but love this style.,5,28/02/2018
"Cute top, comfy,  great going in to fall.","Love this top, runs true to size. looks cute with in style army green cargo pants.  great buy at sale price.",5,04/05/2018
Cute blouse,"This cute blouse runs a little bit small, particularly for large busted ladies. i found the silk fabric to be less luxurious and more utilitarian. it's still a beautiful blouse. due to sizing issues, mine is going back.",4,13/02/2018
Way too big on the bottom,"I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.",1,09/05/2018
I really wanted to love this top!,"I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big.   i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent. with all of the extra material in the back, it billowed out in all the wrong places. the material is comfy and it's a very cute concept, just didn't work for me.",2,13/03/2018
Picture doesn't do it justice!,"This is a super cute top that is a fit and flare design. i think the stylists wanted it to look more straight hence the odd model shots, but this definitely has a flare to it. it also has pockets. it feels a bit artsy to me which isn't normally my style, but the pink and white is just very feminine and pretty. i would say it probably runs a little large because of the style, but i have larger arms, so, the arms were a bit snug in my normal size, but i didn't want to go up in size as the rest fit",4,29/01/2018
Mavis patchwork buttondown,"The prints are subtle, the fabric is soft, and the mismatched buttons are cute. unfortunately, even in an xs, it was huge all over. i love flowy shirts and swing styles, but this just stuck way out from my body and was unflattering.",4,11/02/2018
Large on bottom,"Another lovely, billowy top. i tried on the xsp and the bottom was just huge. and i have a huge bottom - haha! it flowed out so far in the back that it looked silly. it's too bad, because from the waist up, it looks great!",4,17/10/2018
Beautiful blouse- does run large,Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on. it was really cute on her and she loved it. in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size 0 which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes. but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale.,5,21/04/2018
Sweet and airy,"This blouse was just right for me. 5'3' and in my late fifties. not too frilly so still age appropriate yet feminine and fun. i have largish arms from working out and the sleeves fit with give. and at this stage of life, the boxy look that falls just below the waist is flattering. i took a 10 regular (i'm usually a medium r or m-petite) and the fit was comfortable and right. both colors are unusual and it works nicely with pants and skirts.",5,09/02/2018
"Pretty, soft and comfortable","I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i",5,06/04/2018
So pretty!,I love this top! nice lightweight material but not too sheer. runs a little big and may be slightly too boxy for some people; for me it was perfect.,5,17/09/2018
Huge blouse,"I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.",2,03/12/2018
Boxy,This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.,2,16/06/2018
Beautiful blouse!,I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!,5,11/05/2018
Beautiful basic for mild fall weather,"Unfortunately, i am not toned enough to truly show off this beautiful blouse. armholes are cut in a bit too far for my 60 year old arms. was hoping for a pop of color as a basic sleeveless top to layer under sweaters and jackets for traveling, but the neckline wasn't layering as i had hoped. i am only 5'2"" but want a bit more length.
i think this blouse is best worn uncovered as shown, on a toned body that does not require the longer length i prefer. seems to be well made, sadly i must return.",4,18/02/2018
Great for all shapes,This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!,5,15/02/2018
Perfect top for going out or work,"I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.",5,07/05/2018
Silk blouse,"This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.",5,29/07/2018
Perfect fit,This is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once. i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect. no bra showing beneath. yay! it is a beautiful color and design. just love it. i am a typical size 4/6 and size 6 was perfect. i am 36c and no problems in bust area. works well with my short torso. highly recommend. i think it will look great on all body types.,5,13/08/2018
Great shirt,"I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4"" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.",5,27/01/2018
Love this top!,"I bought this in red in xs (5'5 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty, but not in a little girl way, which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced, but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo, it's got an orange-y undertone to it, looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes, i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect.",5,18/08/2018
Maeve...has failed on this,"Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse, only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).
this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though, and the sleeve concept is cute. however, where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.",2,04/09/2018
"Adorable, versatile top for summer","This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. 

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua",5,18/07/2018
Great top!,"Love this top! wore with jeans, comes to about mid hip so good coverage. fit was perfect for me!",5,02/03/2018
Feminine flutter!,"My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le",5,23/08/2018
Perfect summer blouse,"Perfect! very pretty and flattering without being too fussy. helps to hide my tummy and very well made. that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably. usually a 4 or a 6 and i needed a 10 to be comfortable. the 8 went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up. i am never a 10 but that's what worked in this blouse. surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored. definately runs on the smaller side.

lovely. worth the full price in my opinion.",5,20/06/2018
Beautiful and flattering,"I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small, i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly, so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint.",5,23/04/2018
Gorgeous..runs small,Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.,5,06/04/2018
Beautiful,"This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it",5,21/10/2018
Beautiful,"This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.",5,11/11/2018
"Runs small only because of ""vanity"" saizing","I used to be a solid ""2"" then had to move down to 0 and 00... #i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs#, in this definitely a 2. the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing ""up"" #if you are between sizes, choose bigger, teh cutis so flattering, it wont matter#.
the colros are really pretty, the flow of the shirt is romantic, sleeves are forgivin can't go wrong. hte back is a little longer, and covers the tushy. i can see this with flared bottoms, or pencil skirt or skiny jeans, even",5,22/07/2018
Runs small,I love this blouse but my normal size didn't even come close to fitting me. i think i would have had to go 2 sizes up. too bad cause it is a beautiful top. not good for us busty girls though.,3,20/09/2018
Classic anrtho,"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.",5,01/10/2018
Beautiful but runs small,"This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.",5,23/05/2018
Perfect peplum,I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldn't be happier! the feminine/romantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe. i've paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look.,5,01/08/2018
Great little blouse,Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.,5,18/05/2018
Very pretty and flattering,"This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however, it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust, balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price, but i'd probably snap it on sale.",5,11/03/2018
Beautiful top but very small,When i saw this top.... i had to have it.....runs very small... would size up especially if curvy on top.......sheer but not too sheer...... feels and looks delicate...... no problems so far,4,30/08/2018
Cute top. sizing not correct.,"I just purchased this cute top at my local retailer store and definetely the size is way off! in blouses i wear a size 6 (small or medium) with a 34b bust, tall and slender and i had to purchase a size 12 (what????).

overall so cute and could not pass it up. good luck. try it on before purchasing.",4,12/09/2018
Gorgeous and so very feminine!,"Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.",5,03/02/2018
Spring is in the air,"What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.",5,18/02/2018
Beautiful spring blouse,"I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy, and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes, but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me.",5,16/06/2018
"Beautiful spring blouse, but 16s sold out in feb.?","I saw this gorgeous blouse in a store over dark blue jeans on feb. 19. of course, the store stock only went up to a size 12. typical. with the way the 12 fit, i knew i had to size up from my usual size 14, and i did. i ordered it in a size 16, and it arrived on monday, feb. 22 -- with lightening-fast speed. it is breathtaking and fits wonderfully. i like the top button undone, the buttons are gorgeous, and the blouse is very retro, circa 1973, but you definitely have to go up one size. the only",4,11/05/2018

I had such high hopes,"I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.",2,28/11/2018
Beautiful fabric but poor design,"The fabric is beautiful, a bit sheer, but overall lovely. however, the sizing is really off.
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back - my usual size in a fitted top (this one is very fitted in the waist and bust) is a 12. i tried the 12 and 14, and the side zipper wouldn't come near closing. it is very, very nipped right under the bust.
so, if you have no bustline and a super small waist, this top is for you. if you are like me, high waist and straight up and down, this is a pass. in fact, it is really h",4,11/11/2018
"Lovely, but snug!","This is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale! trust the other reviewers that it does run small! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top, and i got the 4 - and it's a bit snug! it is very fitted below the bust, but that's what makes it look so nice on. i would definitely recommend, but know that sizing is off.",4,23/01/2018
Pretty and feminine,"I tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love it...too bad i don't need yet anothr black top. fit is loose/flowy, but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt. tried on regualr xs, i could proably go to petites though, but thankfully there is a button at the neck",5,27/09/2018
Great fit,"I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering, although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much, but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.",5,05/12/2018
Wearing this blouse right now,It feels weightless and is so feminine. great for layering or on its own. so happy i purchased it - know i will get tons of use out of it.,5,20/07/2018

Gorgeous blouse,"This is a stunning blouse! you can't tell from the photo, but it looks very 1930-1940's. i am so happy with this blouse, it is gorgeous. i'm an xl, and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully. it fits nice and flowy and i feel i don't need a cam underneath. i highly recommend it!",5,08/08/2018
So cute,"This top is truly adorable. it runs a little shorter so better with higher waisted pants. the bow is nice. it did come with the folded pleats showing. we'll see if they come out when i iron? i ordered 0 and am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. the top is structured and zips all the way in the back.",5,24/11/2018
Looks great with white pants,Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.,5,18/08/2018
Wow,"This one is way better in person. admittedly, i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well, it is great. a little sheer, adn super static-y when i received it, but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking, but this doe'n'tt come in petites,so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too, neutral, event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish, it stil lcan be worn with anything..",5,30/09/2018
Very cute online,I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.,3,28/05/2018
"Yup, no ruffle.","Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle, such a bummer, sleeves are much longer, and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger, in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it, but consider the mentioned if buying.",3,25/06/2018
Cute but not as pictured,"So this is still a pretty cute shirt, but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective, just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front, as that is what caught my eye.",3,31/08/2018
No ruffle but cute,"I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern, but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.",3,29/01/2018
So soft!,Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.,5,27/04/2018

Great tee!,"This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)",5,03/06/2018
Unique blouse; comfortable fit,"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit nicely. tops from tiny can sometimes be really tiny, but this blouse is cut correctly for it's size. i'm full figured and busty and the xl fit comfortably. if you're athletic or have a petite bust or are slender you might be able to size down.

Lovely,The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!,5,03/12/2018
So pretty...,"Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi",5,19/03/2018
Just the right amount of pizzazz,"This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.",5,30/01/2018
Stunning day to evening top,"This top is so gorgeous! the color, the embroidery, the neckline, are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part, but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.",5,27/09/2018
Sweet on embroidery,Soft. fitted without being tight. flattering neckline. nice embroidery.,5,19/09/2018
Unique and a great fit,I love tiny tops- they fit great. i buy a small. i wish this was a henly style like some of their past versions of this embroidered style top but i still ike it and will get a lot of wear out of it. at first i thought it was too much detal but it grew on me after pulling an outfit together. won't dissapoint.,4,28/10/2018
Great find,Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.,5,06/03/2018

Easy and breezy,"This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.",5,29/05/2018
Fun casual summer top,"Love the floral pattern.  top is loose and flowy, as expected.  i like to tick it into my jeans or shorts, so it doesn't look quite so shapeless on me.",4,31/08/2018
Fit,"I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.",5,31/10/2018
"Great, casual tank","This top does run quite large. i am normally an xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a), and i was debating between the xs and xsp. the xxs was out of stock, so i wasn't able to try it on for size. the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model, but it was also a little too low cut for me on top. the straps are twisted and not adjustable, so i went with the xsp, which is what i'm wearing in the photo. it does come up a little shorter, but it fits me better in the bust. the f",5,24/11/2018
Love it!,"Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy, dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.",5,01/07/2018
Pretty shirt,"This tank is pretty. it looks nice and is not cut too low. the bottom is ""flowy"" and not extremely fitted. i always get a lot of compliments when i wear it.",4,15/08/2018
A unique tank,"The flower print really caught my eye. i like the unique twisted neckline. there is a lot of material here, but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops.",5,01/10/2018
Will shrink significantly when washed!,"This top is very pretty, but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small, which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can",3,26/05/2018
Runs huge!,"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small, and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another.",3,06/07/2018
Beautiful top,I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.,5,12/04/2018
This looked surprizingly really cute in person,"I didn't expect the fit to be as cute, i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top, but untucked, or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person, still light turquoise, but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy, but not oversized or boxy.",5,26/02/2018
Perfect!,Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!,5,01/04/2018
Great shirt,This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,5,02/07/2018
Another great tiny henley,"I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you won't be disappointed with this one.",5,07/04/2018
This top surprised me!,"This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn't expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great!",5,11/08/2018
Beautiful blouse,"Bought this for my daughter in law's birthday. it's just a beautiful, feminine design, well made, nice fabric.. she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out. very versatile.",5,16/09/2018
Pretty blouse,This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise.,5,13/07/2018
Very simple little sweater,I bought this to go with the pants they had online & i love them together. the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it.,5,19/10/2018
Unusual cardigan,"I bought this cardigan online and loved it as soon as it arrived. i bought it on my usual small but it fit very big. this is a nice unusual looking cardi and has a very sporty style , so i wouldn't use it in the office. the material is very soft and slightly on the thin side. i am 5'4"" and 160lbs. i had to return it because the small was too big and couldn't find a xs at the store or online.. size down.",4,11/11/2018
Boxy,"I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn't for me.",2,10/06/2018
Ok,I was not a fan. cute design but the sweater was not soft it felt thick like a weird blanket. the arms were small and the body was big... odd combo. the material didn't make me want to put it on. it went back.,3,09/09/2018
Quite stylish,"Love this one. i usually wear a medium, got this in medium and fits perfectly. i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms, they are a little snug, but i like the fit just as is. the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for.",5,09/03/2018
Runs big,I normally wear a small and sometimes a medium. even the extra small feels large all over and in the length. it's gorgeous though.,4,25/03/2018
Size way down,"This is a beautiful top if you size way down. i normally wear a small in tiny tops. i had to buy an xxs petite in this top. even still there is a little extra material around the sides, but i've received a ton of compliments on the top.",4,06/02/2018
Just okay,I personally didn't like it enough to purchase but it is a well made top. in the photos i am wearing a medium and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.,3,16/11/2018
Beautiful embroidery,The embroidery around the chest/collar is lovely.  but the lower half of the shirt didn't fit my post-pregnancy bod.  it's going back.,4,19/03/2018
Like it but armholes are too big,"I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty, perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty, but the fit is selective, so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.",3,13/07/2018
Beautiful detail,I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.,5,26/07/2018
Unflattering,I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.,2,18/04/2018
Flattering details,I love the fit and feel of this shirt. the fit is narrow but true to size. the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile.,5,08/12/2018
Lightweight and unique,"This shirt is absolutely beautiful! the front is very thin and delicate, but wearing a nude bra underneath, you can't see a thing. i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest ""gap"" but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesn't appear to ""pull"" at all. it's hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested. this one is it!!!!",5,19/09/2018
Nice design but not that great,"Online, i like the design, the leaves stand out. in-person, the leaves don't stand out as much, you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame, i think. it was just too light and thin for me.",3,18/05/2018
Poor quality,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,1,05/10/2018
Floral fave,Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt. super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well. a great transition piece.,5,02/12/2018
A true tiny,"I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.",5,23/05/2018
Lovely but shrinks a lot,"This blouse is gorgeous, but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through, not the front, though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size, the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold, delicate cycle, hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.",3,23/11/2018
Order in dress size,"Really great shirt, i made the mistake of ordering normal size (xs) and it was way too small. this is more like ordering in dress shirt size- so think 4, 6, 8, etc, definitely going to have to send back and order up to s or m. will be a keeper once i get the right fit!",5,20/02/2018
So flimsy,"I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room, i could see through the entire shirt, front to back, before even putting it on. once on, i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on, it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while",2,09/03/2018
Cute top,Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail,4,09/07/2018
Beautiful but didn't work for me,"I loved this top when i tried it on. i'm usually a small or medium and ordered the medium based on these reviews. the only problem with this for me was that you can see through it in the back. it showed every lump and bump around my bra. reluctantly, i am going to return it. if you don't have any lumps and bumps i think this is a great top. i wish it had worked for me. i debated about trying it on with a camisole to see if that would help, but don't really want to have to wear a camisole in the",4,27/03/2018
Adorable,"Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .",5,29/05/2018
So boxy!,"For my body type, this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e., boobs) this would work better.",3,22/05/2018
Like wearing just a cozy tee but way better,"White, lace, peplum...all my jams so this top was a no brainer order. what i didn't realize was how cozy the cotton would be. it was like just wearing a cozy tee, but looked so much better. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly.",5,13/03/2018
"Pretty, but not great","I feel like this top is almost perfect, but there's something missing. the details are nice, the fit is fine, but something wasn't right. maybe it was the weird arm length?

fits tts, if a tad on the large side.",4,23/08/2018
Nice white top,"Beautiful white top. peplum never looged good on me until i found this one. i am 5.4, 34 dd and this peplum looked good on me. most white tops are see through int he front and this one isn't. but back is a little see through. for casual that much see though is good. not sure for office. but this is still a keeper for me :)",4,30/06/2018
Too thin,"I would have to wear a camisole underneath this, which is odd considering it's still two layered in the front. i wanted an easy white shirt to wear, not something i'd have to layer.",3,23/02/2018
Classic,"I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.",5,19/11/2018
Lovely and versatile,"Imo this top does run small. arms were tight in the size xs and just a bit snug in the s. top is definitely versatile. i don't usually wear peplum tops due a larger chest (34d-dd) and they usually look like maternity tops on me, however this one did not. the problem with this top is the fabric in the back of the top is shearer than i'd like. you can see every bulge and bump of your bra. i felt you'd need to cover your back with either long hair, jacket, vest or cardigan. not a deal breaker becau",4,05/07/2018
Sweet!,"Love this top, the contrasting lace/eyelet is pretty and interesting. it flairs in a flattering way.",5,25/08/2018
Nice find--check out the extra photo!,"It must be hard to photograph white clothing. this lovely top is almost invisible in the featured photo, but it is accurately photographed in the extra photo with the model in a jacket. this will feel and look great with cardigans or cropped, stylish jackets. i'm so glad i ordered this lovely, white, lacey top, and i do recommend it to you. i only dinged it one star because it would be even better in cotton and silk, which are frequent tiny brand materials. i went with the size large, as this be",4,08/06/2018
Love this tee!,"I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac",5,19/07/2018
"Nice design, runs large","I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot, especially the front macrame part, but for me it did not work at all. also, too expensive for a tee.",3,08/06/2018
Perfect summer staple,"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it's simple and sexy, easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect, i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i don't typically wear red so that wasn't an option for me, i do wish it came in more colors!",5,28/10/2018
Pretty details,I have this shirt in the gray and in the orange and i just love the details on front.,4,16/10/2018
Beautiful but boxy,"I thought this top was absolutely beautiful online, and it doesn't disappoint in person. the fabric is divine, and i just love the paisley design. after putting it on though, it did look just a tad boxy, but not enough to return it. i would definitely recommend the top, and maybe a cute belt to accompany!",4,22/07/2018
Beautiful top,"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",5,10/06/2018
Too low-cut,"The pattern and colors are very pretty, and the material is soft and silky. i returned it, though, because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts, which is not going to work for me.",2,20/08/2018
Pretty top,"Wasn't sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did.
it is much prettier in person. soft and silky.
great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)",5,31/01/2018
Pretty and flowy,"This shirt is very pretty in person, although more orange than it appears in picture. i got it for 25% off the sale price, which was definitely worth it, but i wouldn't have paid more than that. the back has a soft tshirt jersey material with a gray and white print. the neckline is a little weird, gathers kind of strangely, but other than that, a really pretty top.",4,02/09/2018
"Gorgeous and airy, but large!","Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands, but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely, with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.",3,29/07/2018
Uncomfortable,I didn't realize that there were sequins on the design. they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable. the white material was also not very flattering on me. it went back.,2,28/05/2018
Must see in person,"It's easy to miss the fine details that make this top special.the fabric inset around the collar & front placket is an abstract blossoming spring branch print overlaid with 3d decorative embroidery and clear sequins & is trimmed with a delicate lace. the sequins are eye-catching in a very subtle, shimmery way.

beautiful under a sweater, love the top's double layer look, fits tts, not too sheer. 

you might have to wear a strapless bra or do without one altogether because of the neckline and",5,16/08/2018
Not what i thought,"I loved the look of this top when i saw it online, however, when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful, but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!",3,19/06/2018
Beautiful colors,"This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern, and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.",5,30/06/2018
"Very cute, but tight sleeves","This top is very cute. it looks good with leggings, boyfriend jeans, and flare jeans. be careful, it will shrink. i bought an xs because other reviews said it runs large. it fit great, but i accidentally put it in the dryer and it shrunk. the sleeves that were already were fitted and not loose like the picture shows, shrunk so that they are a little snug on my arms. thankfully, it's still wearable because i do love it and have gotten several compliments on it.",4,23/05/2018
"Pretty blouse, if it is built for you","Overall, i thought this was a very pretty blouse. i loved the colors and the design. the construction seemed good. others mentioned that it ran large, but i am tall and often struggle with the shoulders and arms, so i purchase my normal size small. i believe it is the width in my shoulders that caused the blouse to hang funny - you could see a decent amount of the back fabric hanging around the front sides, which looked odd. it made the front fabric look like it was cut at an angle.

Top that works with lots of colors,Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.,5,16/10/2018
Very pretty cardigan,"I love this cardigan. i purchased it in the cream color. however, it did fray a bit after washing it. other than that, i think it was a great buy though!",5,21/09/2018
Beautiful top,"I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.",5,03/11/2018
Beautiful top,"This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.",5,28/07/2018
Pretty and girly,I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.,5,15/11/2018
Gorgeous top,"This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy, the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect, tts. great for work or casual party.",5,14/02/2018
Love it!,"I bought a size s in the navy, and m in the neutral, and both fit. i usually wear a small, but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big, but the extra room fits the flowy, bohemian style of the blouse, so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.",5,27/11/2018
Beautiful!,"I love that this top is dressy, yet comfy. it is perfect for work and relaxing with friends after. i recommend purchasing this blouse.",5,01/03/2018
Casual type dressy,"This blouse is perfect for semi dressy occasions silver ribbon adds a nice, subdued sparkle accent and no need to add a camisole due to the nice lining.",4,15/10/2018
Lovely embroidery,This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.,5,03/07/2018
Gorgeous in person,"I'm so glad i saw this in the store, as the online photo does not do it justice. it's elegant, detailed, and a beautiful shade of pink. it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors.",5,02/03/2018
Pretty much beautiful,"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3",5,25/04/2018
Beautiful,"I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.",5,09/09/2018
Delicate and dress up top,"Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin",5,20/07/2018
Too small,"Love the top, but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.",2,25/10/2018

Cute but tight in the chest,I have several tiny tunics in m. i received this one today and it is very cute but too tight in the chest. i'm returning it for a large.,4,14/09/2018
Disappointed,I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.,1,24/09/2018
Can be dressed up or down,This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!,5,23/04/2018
Like it a lot but...,"I like this top a lot, very nice. i love the design, style, and fabric. but it runs too small. i have a curvy figure, and it pulls in the front so you can see between the buttons, and pulls at the bottom as well. i usually wear l or xl, in xl this one was still a bit fitted especially around the bust. i am still keeping it - hoping to lose a few pounds. but it is a very nice top with the fabric, design, and style. very stylish! it looks casual on the model but can be dressy.",4,29/05/2018
Very cute!!,"I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!",5,31/03/2018
Even better than pictured!,"This shirt is so beautiful and fits perfectly. it is so soft too, i didn't expect it to be so soft!",5,17/08/2018
Beautiful,"This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami.",5,17/02/2018
Beautiful but too small for me!,"Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it
was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!",3,15/05/2018
Buy one size up!,"Love this shirt, bought this shirt, returning this shirt. believe this and the other reviewers who say it runs small, especially through the bust, and even if you're not busty. it's now sold out in my size, wish i'd gotten a bigger size that i could keep!",4,14/02/2018
Beauty and the beast,"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area, or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule, but i shouldn't have to! 5'7""",3,11/11/2018
Gaps at the top button - but so pretty,"This blouse is very pretty, but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it, or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.",3,04/04/2018
Very low cut...and a weird snap,"Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then",2,15/07/2018
Pretty but awkward,"I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny, which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway, the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top, and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where",3,29/08/2018
Hooray...it came in a petite!,Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .,5,01/04/2018
Ehhh...,"I liked the product shots of this cardigan, but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting, the fabric was rougher, the lace was scratchy, the fit was boxy, and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute, but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale, but for now it goes back...",3,29/04/2018
Very large,Very pretty cardigan but it is huge! i ordered a large (normally xl or large) and it is so big! the shoulder seam comes to middle of my upper arm. i wanted to exchange it for a medium but they are out of stock. bummer.,4,29/04/2018
Dolman style sleeves & scratchy lace,"I tried this on in store yesterday and didn't buy it due to the dolman style sleeves and the scratchy lace.  dolman sleeves look terrible on me, so this was a no go.  beware the scratchy lace...i had this on for about 2 minutes and was itching.  otherwise, this will wok for plenty of people - the color can be a nice neutral.  it does run large - i usually wear a large and sized down to a medium.  it didn't work for me, but i'm sure some will find it a nice part of their wardrobe.",4,27/02/2018
Think i'll like it,"Pretty color.
love the lace.
my husband thought it looked a little ""old lady-ish"", but i think it depends on what you wear it with....
it's been too hot here to wear yet. i believe it will look great with a cami and leggings!",4,23/10/2018
Comfortable and versatile,"The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans.",5,30/08/2018
Terrible but had so much potential,"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store, in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily, my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol",2,31/05/2018
Beautiful,"I almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.",5,09/03/2018
Vintage luxury,I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,5,14/03/2018
I love tiny!,I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.,5,09/06/2018
Winner,"There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful, flowing, light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.

i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment, some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t",4,13/03/2018
Pretty but too unstructured,The colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size. it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something. it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i'm petite. i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans. just really wanted to love it!,4,27/07/2018
Pricey for what it is,The front and back materials differ. the back of the shirt is soft and thin. the front embroidery is stiff but i imagine it will soften after a wash. pretty shirt though.,4,12/05/2018
Very pretty but sheer,"I wanted to love this top but found it to run small and was too sheer for my taste. it is a beautiful top though, but you will need a cami with it.",4,28/11/2018
Pretty top,"The only reason i gave this top a 4 star, is that it didn't have enough room around the bust area. i'm a d cup, and the front didn't button properly. but for the price i paid (40% off sale price), i have no coplaints.
i would recommend.",4,14/02/2018
Beautiful sheer top with weird hem,"I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so, when you wear the necessary base layer, the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea",3,04/11/2018
Another great tiny top.,"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",5,07/11/2018
Extremely sheer!,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,2,20/04/2018
Love love love...just really sheer,Absolutely love this shirt - the embroidery on the front is beautiful. gold and silver metallic thread with good quality. very slim fit through the torso with loose sleeves. the only downside is the cream material is very sheer - definitely have to wear a tank underneath.,4,23/08/2018
Sheer shirt,"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes",2,14/02/2018
"Beautiful, slim fit top","This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.",5,02/07/2018
Lovely top,This top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.,5,06/11/2018
Gorgeous,"After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas",5,22/04/2018
Cute top,"This is a really cute top. yes, it is dry clean only but i plan on hand washing it. one negative is that it is extremely short in length. i'm 5 feet tall and this top barely goes past my bellybutton. it's extremely soft though and definitely different.",4,25/06/2018
Note this is a crop top,Listed on the package labeling but not in the product description. i am short in the waist and this is still much shorter than pictured. disappointed to send this one back as it's otherwise perfect.,4,07/04/2018
Dry clean?!,This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer,1,27/05/2018
This top is just meh,Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.,2,06/06/2018
Sheer shoulders,One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,1,04/06/2018
Unique but a little short,I was thrilled to find this in a store to try it on. the fabric is light weight and the cut of the sleeves make it very unique. my only gripe is the length. it hits the very top of my pants. so if you lift your arms in any way because of the cut of the sleeves - the whole shirt lifts up and shows belly. but i loved the elegance of it so much i decided that i can live with the shortness. i will just wear a tucked in cami underneath. this fit true to size.,4,18/11/2018
Love this but there are some flaws,"I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the",5,26/07/2018
Great piece!,"Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent, colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down, worn with a number of various styles - jeans, dress pants, skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit, the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small, but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate",5,16/07/2018
Really unique top,"Really interesting, beautiful colors. i found it to be short, even in the regular size (and i'm 5'1 with a short torso). wish the fit was slimmer, but i could see it working with jeans, or being stunning with a black ball skirt.",4,03/03/2018
Not as expected,"I ordered this in a l online, and wasn't a fan when i received it. the colors are pretty bright, but they also look cheap in my opinion. it also had an awkward fit, because of the material there is no give at all, it was really tight on my chest (36d) for reference. and it was also pretty short, and i'm short! it barely hit the top of my pants...and i'm 5'2! back it went.",2,07/09/2018
"Pretty color and pattern combination, boyish style","The colors and textures on this top are fun. however, the boxy shape isn't very flattering and poofs out a bit around the belly. maybe it would look a bit more feminine on someone with a curvier chest. i would size up if between sizes because the top part around the arms is not very roomy. i tried it on at the store but decided to pass because the xs was a little tight around the arms but the s billowed around the belly too much. still a cute piece if it works for you fit-wise.",4,31/10/2018
Unique statement sweater,"This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.",5,29/04/2018
Even more beautiful in real life,"The colors are really lovely--bright and vibrant. the sleeve and back fabric is comfortable and breathable. it is dry-clean only because of the brocade, but definitely worth it! i'm usually s but preferred the xs fit.",5,24/07/2018
Colorful sweater,Great sweater for any occasion. may be dressed up and/or worn with jeans. very versatile. love that it is short sleeves. size is true to fit.,5,09/04/2018
Great statement piece,"This is a beautiful and comfortable top. the brocade front panel is a nice take on a traditional pattern but in bright colors with a metallic sheen. the knit sleeves and back are a stretchy, nubby complement. overall, a great piece and perfect for the holidays.",5,04/04/2018
Love it but runs small,"I love the print and design, the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist, and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top, the colors are vibrant and shiny, totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits.",4,17/08/2018
Prettier in person,I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.,5,22/01/2018
Hospital white lace on top of taupe sweatshirt,"The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.",2,07/08/2018
"Pretty, yet boxy","While this top is pretty, it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad, because i really wanted to like it.",3,26/02/2018
Great sweater,I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!,5,12/02/2018
Comfy go-to cardigan,"I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. 
it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.",5,10/06/2018
Fun and adorable!,I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!,5,09/10/2018
Supah cute!,"So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied, but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes! 
fits tts.",5,03/03/2018
Not for the petite,"I love the design and color of this cardigan, and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately, it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2"", 105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties, as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring, but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel",3,01/10/2018
Perfect summer tee,This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.,5,19/10/2018
Perfectly drapey,"I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable.  it's perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10.",5,08/06/2018
Decent little tee,"You won't break the bank with this cute tee. loved that it's not a thin fabric. the variation in the stripes adds interest, too. i ordered a large, my regular size, and it fit well. i returned because it was a bit on the long side on my short frame, the colors didn't suit me and i need long sleeve tees now that we're heading into the colder months.",4,21/07/2018
Sleeves too tight,"Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.",1,29/03/2018
Great casual top,This might be one of my new go to tops. looks cute with jeans and a sweater or alone. the arms are snug but not uncomfortable and i think it adds to the shirt.,4,07/08/2018
Cute but a little maternity looking,"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?",3,16/02/2018
Flows nicely,"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.",5,15/07/2018
Actually nice and comfrotable,"This says online only, hwoever the balc one was in my store (and some other colros too). anyway, i actually liked this top, it is more flattering than the model shows, i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos. on me, the regualr size is almost a dress (should i be younger), but i do like that (i did debate ordering petite, and decided not to). it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors, and sublte stripes on the black version.
noyte: previous reviewer mentioend something about",5,04/10/2018
Not as described,"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.",2,04/11/2018
Holy tightness,"This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4"". the large fit like a small on me, and not like a typical oversized sweater type small, but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight, and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the",2,07/07/2018
More of a lounge/layering top,"The neutral color was at my local retailer, which is a rich brown/mocha, much nicer looking in person. like others, this is quite sheer and thin. however, it is so stretchy, breathable, and comfortable that i would use this for layering instead. for my 5'9"", 36c, hourglass frame, i found the medium to be rather body hugging. it was not at all loose like on the model. for me, this is fine because i will layer, eliminating issues of sheerness.",4,18/11/2018
Chic + comfy,I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,5,31/03/2018
Love the silhouette...but the shirt is see through,"This shirt had everything going for it - the cut, the length, the fun texture, but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing, but still cute.",3,13/05/2018
Comfy and warm,"I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected, which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however, i did keep it because",3,15/06/2018
Red version in xl is perfect,"I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.",5,23/05/2018
"Really cute shirt, but don't upsize","Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.",5,28/03/2018
So much better in person!!!,"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi",5,16/10/2018
"Fun pattern, great fit","I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.",5,05/06/2018
Tee shirt material... blowsy,"I didn't realize the patterned material was tee shirt material. i got lots of compliments on it though. i'ts blowsey from the bust down (i got the short sleeved red one) but it's comfortable without looking sloppy. if you can pull off the tucked in look, it's super cute.",4,03/07/2018
Fun top!,"I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!",5,10/09/2018
Boxy but cute,"I got the red, which was short sleeved. the shirt itself was so cute, but the fit is very boxy. i got a small and it was way too wide. far wider and shorter in the waist than the picture shows. i am sad to return, but it makes me look like a square. (shape that is)",3,24/02/2018
"Cute, runs large","This top runs very large and is loose fitting in the middle. it looks very flattering and is very comfortable. i bought the one in red and it looks quite good. i would go down one size, maybe two.",4,10/11/2018
Great ultra casual top,"Really pretty blue top. great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door, of if you have to run a quick errand! if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe. the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color. don't get me wrong. the top is casual and cute. it is not sloppy and has an international, worldly vibe. i recommend it.",5,31/08/2018
Perfect,I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it.,5,21/05/2018
Fancy tank,The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,5,29/06/2018
Mis-sized,"This is a great looking top but the sizing is way off. in the photo it looks a little oversized. i am normally a medium but this one was very small, sleeves several inches too short and it is more like 25"" long instead of the 35"" listed on the description. in the right size i think it will be great but i'm not sure whether to go up one size or two.",4,10/11/2018
Nothing like the picture!,"I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.",1,01/03/2018
So cute. too small.,"So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug, so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!",4,26/04/2018
"My best retailer purchase, ever","36dd, size 10/12 top and 12/14 bottom

these tank tops are literally the best thing i have ever purchased from retailer. the colors and patterns are gorgeous - i have four of these (yellow, green, navy birds and the white with navy flower)! the top layer and middle liner are heavy, high quality polyester. the bottom layer is a comfortable knit. the extra layers make this top warmer than most tanks - it's perfect for layering under a sweater or jacket. it's very loose and flowy. i could have",5,03/09/2018
In love,"This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am, you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.",5,23/05/2018
Different and flattering,Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great. very flattering and a fun take on plaid. more feminine than your classic plaid button down.,5,21/03/2018
Fun take on plaid,"I was looking for a red and black plaid top with a twist, and this tee definitely fits the bill! i plan to wear this shirt with a long sleeve tee under it for extra warmth for casual holiday events, and can see it with a skirt and cardi for work. fabric is soft and comfortable. fit is loose but not too boxy.",4,26/08/2018
Cute & different,I bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid. the first day i wore it i received many compliments. the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath. i don't think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time. i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso. i am normally a size 6/m/34b and the med fit perfectly.,5,13/04/2018
Cool and casual,"This top is a nice piece to transition into fall. it goes well with jeans, but it could also be dressed up with black pants.",5,24/04/2018
Versatile great top,"I've worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans. looks great with both. it's almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style. i'm 5'3, 165 and the large fit great. it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots. only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low, so side of my bra is visible. but overall it's well worth it!",5,24/01/2018
Happy with the look and fit,"I love the built in layers of this shirt. it looks great layered with a long sleeved shirt underneath for winter also. being a teen in the 90s, it reminds me of a little bit of grunge, but in a less brooding more classy way. if only i still had my doc martins... i find the fit to be great, slightly loose, but not baggy and the fabric feels light but not fragile.",4,05/08/2018
Cute and versatile!,"I tried the red version at store, it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual.",5,28/03/2018
Love it!,"I got a m in this top and was a little scared but i absolutly love this top, i was debating on it and then caught it on the 30% off sale, my first retailer purchase and it definitely won't be my last! great quality, so comfortable, and very cute!",5,15/04/2018
I bought both colors,"It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style, but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.",5,12/11/2018
I bought both colors,I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.,5,08/11/2018
Splendid never disappoints,"This tee is s bit on the pricey side but well with it. soft fabric, and unique mix beautiful colors (i got the grey, blush, and gold) that will offer a lot of options on terms of what it can be worn with. i love splendid and this tee is why i do!",5,24/06/2018
"Soft, comfy perfect summer top","Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.",5,15/08/2018
Couldn't....help....myself!,Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.,5,23/03/2018
Great top!,"This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it, but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!",4,18/08/2018
Perfect!,This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,5,24/06/2018
Would have been a great look...,"But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves, but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.",3,22/02/2018
Nice for summer,I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.,5,18/07/2018
This top runs both small and true to size,"This top has a lot of potential (comfortable, easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small, medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model, too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom. 
i tried the green in the sto",3,13/07/2018
Perfect for almost any weather,"I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.",5,10/05/2018
Great buy!,"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

this tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that doesn't cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh",5,02/03/2018
Great top!,This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.,5,14/08/2018
Soft & pretty,Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.,5,05/06/2018
Love it!!!,"I bought this item in store, in the loden green color. i absolutely love it as a light winter dress or tunic. the material is thin, but provides a nice coverage nonetheless. it is super duper comfy, and very figure flattering! i wear it mainly as a dress, and looks great with tights and ankle boots. so pleased ordering the other color.",4,02/10/2018
Tighter than expected,"I ordered this in green when it was on sale and was so excited to get it. i thought the color would compliment my complexion perfectly. i read the other reviews who mentioned this item fit closer to the body than what is shown on the model - i wish i would have listened. while it is a very comfortable piece and stretches, it is a lot tighter than i wanted and because of that it is a bit see through. i didn't want to have to wear a cami underneath and i am pretty curvy. this top does show many of",4,19/10/2018
Unimpressed,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,2,02/03/2018
Not as expected,"The material was thin, showed every lump you'd rather hide and clung to the body. even the sleeves were tight. looked inexpensive.",2,02/08/2018
Cagrcoal shimmer fun,"I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.",5,25/06/2018
"Shimmer, surprisingly goes with lots","I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn't go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size...",4,10/04/2018
Amazingly soft and comfy but...,"This is so so soft and has a nice stretch to it. the fit is great, love the side zippers. i wore it today for the first time and before i even arrived at the office i noticed a crazy amount of pilling where my purse rubbed. nothing i cant get rid of (till next time i carry a bag!) but if this keeps up there soon won't be much of a shirt left. very disappointing for the price. was lucky enough to snag this on sale but it was still pricey for the quality.",3,24/10/2018
Perfect for spring,"Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.",5,11/11/2018
Sooo comfortable and slouchy/drapey - in good ways,"This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.",5,27/10/2018
Average top,"This is an average top. i thought it would be a good work shirt (my office is very causal), but it was just too loungey looking. fit is true to size. the fabric is thin- a little see through. not worth $108 in my opinion. i returned it.",3,12/09/2018
Nice little t,"This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through, but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.",4,04/05/2018
Just alright,"I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however, this was really tight. also, the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.",3,30/03/2018
Classic,"Love this top.
the fit is perfection!
the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size.",5,15/04/2018
Runs small,"This top is beautiful in the model shot, but average in person. it ran really small, i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest, and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also, the material is very thin, not so much that you can see your undergarment, but if you get cold everyone will know it. also, for the price, i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale, if you are interested in this top.",3,21/11/2018
Disappointing,"I was expecting a tunic with a bit of structure and weight to layer over leggings, with boots, etc.

this is just an oversized turtleneck - there's nothing special about it. it's thin material. nothing to justify the price.

the sizing seems odd. i'm normally a 2 on the top and 4 on the bottom. the xs was huge up top (i was swimming in it - much larger than it appears in pictures on the model) and spanned across my hips (more than the model).

even if i could find a size that worked, there was n",3,17/08/2018
So flattering,"A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark , faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality, textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.",5,31/03/2018
"So flattering, no need for petite","I just tried this top on in xs regular even though i generally wear xspetite in retailer and it fit great (34aa - 26 - 34). i think it's flattering on my fairly straight body with the halter neck, fitted waist and peplum. i would guess it would be flattering on many body types; it highlights shoulders beautifully. it was very hard to get my head through the small, not-too-stretchy opening so you may want to try it on without makeup. i knocked off one star because the neck band wasn't symmetrical,",4,09/11/2018
Beautiful classic shirt!,"This shirt runs a little big, i bought it for my niece who usually wears a medium , but the small fit her. she is tall and this was a nice length on her.it's very comfortable and is a a perfect staple to send her off to college with. i paired it with the nouveau belt in silver- as an option for her to wear it with- great buy!

Carpet fabric,"The fabric is really itchy, i felt like i was wearing a carpet, and it reminded me of the 70's fabric crimplene. this will not be comfy in humid weather. the top also had a strange synthetic odor.it was returned.",3,09/06/2018
Comfy and not binding,"I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!",5,26/07/2018
Hole in it after a month,"I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam, so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.",2,05/02/2018
Thin layering turtleneck,"I ordered this turtleneck in white and was very surprised to find that the material is so thin and gauzy it's sheer. i will definitely have to wear a white camisole under this every time i wear it, even when using it as a layering piece. it seems to run true to size if not a little small. the neck is interesting because it is so light and floppy...you can adjust several ways. it doesn't hold form well, though. i will most likely keep it but will never wear it without something both under and ove",3,05/07/2018
So sexy,"The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!!",4,08/05/2018
Beautiful but runs large.,"This is a beautiful top, but it runs large.
i am exchanging for one size smaller.
it is worth the effort of exchanging!
well made, beautiful lace.",5,09/02/2018
Great top!,"The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!",5,19/09/2018
A favorite this season,This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.,5,17/10/2018
Looks just like the pic,"The fabric of this top is a tee shirt, mid weight material. it has a nice drape and the color variations along the vee are true to the photo. i purchased size large and it's a bit wide and long for my frame. you could safely size down. the fabric drapes nicely but i didn't like the sleeves or length and it fits large so am returning.",4,16/10/2018
A very cute cropped topper,"This is an adorable topper for all these ballgowns when you have no top. that said, it was a lot shorter on me than i expected. i attribute this to the fact that i have a chest. the fit is true to size, but while not showing much tightness around the chest to any gape in the buttons in the back, it became more of a crop top. i have been needing a short topper so i'm definitely keeping this. the back button detail is adorable. the lace for me is soft and not stratchy or irritating but i only trie",5,17/06/2018
"Wow, beautiful!","This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3"", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!",5,28/03/2018
Ooooo! love this so much more than i thought,"This blouse is beautiful, and very versatile, as others have said. i seem to have been buying many maeve prints lately, and got used to that fit. this blouse fits slimmer, but not tight, and ends up extremely flattering. the arms are also a bit slimmer in cut but not too tight -- the fabric has a little give/stretch and so even f they aren't totally loose, it's still comfortable. the lace detail is subtle but pretty. i am going to wear this to death, i can tell.",5,13/04/2018
Cute and unique top,"This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders, but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side, but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting",4,27/01/2018
Good just not great.,Nice shirt seems well made. good just not a great fit for me.,4,16/10/2018
Very pretty and comfortable,"A very beautiful, flattering, and breathable/comfortable mock neck turtleneck that's great for layering. for those unfamiliar with weston, this top - like many of their others - is essentially made of panty hose nylon. it makes for a super comfy and stretchy top, albeit a delicate one. be mindful with your hair accessories and jewelery when wearing this!

Better in the photo,"I was excited to receive this top because i love the design, but was very disappointed when it arrived. i thought the embroidery would be striking but it's not. the material is a t-shirt knit which also added to the disappointment. it was not flattering at all.",3,05/03/2018
Very cute,"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this.",5,05/09/2018
Wanted to love it!,"Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).
sadly, it's going back.",3,23/09/2018
Favorite summer top,"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?",5,06/04/2018

Maternity top,"I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.",2,01/02/2018
"Unusual, cool, fun top","I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!",5,07/12/2018
Soft tank for the summer,"I just purchased this tank in white and blue. i find it to be soft and will be perfect for hot days but also can wear into the fall with a cardigan. it's super comfy but i do find at retailer that it's best to try things on in the store (it's hard to find perfect sizes online since things are cut so differently based on the designer). i got a large and though it's a bit flowy in the tummy area, it fits nicely across my chest (not tight).",4,08/03/2018
Nice top,"I love love this top. i was on the fence about it since it runs large and is loose fitting, very loose. i tried m, l, and xl. i usually wear xl but bought an l in this. i tried m, it was loose around the mid-section but fitted at the top. i wore them with fitted skinny pants and the top looks amazing. perfect for summer. the armholes also look flattering - not too big. i like turquoise. i didn't find yellow in the store, so bought green and white. it does need some ironing.",4,31/10/2018
Wish it was longer length,"I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but, the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin",3,27/01/2018
"Odd, boxy fit","I purchased this shirt in grey. i loved the color and the details, especially the lace on the shoulders. i just found the fit to be off for me. the style certainly calls for a relaxed fit but the small was loose in an unflattering way. had the xs been available i might have considered exchanging for an xs but the s was already a bit short on me.

Flattering tee,This is a really flattering tee for my curves. pretty lace details. i purchased the gray and ordered the wine. the pink looked more peach to me in the store. only reason for 4 stars is that the back material wrinkles easily. true to size (large) for me.,4,07/08/2018

Odd dimensions,"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",2,29/03/2018

usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",5,08/07/2018

Flattering and easy,"I tried this top because i loved the not so simple, simpleness of it. however, it was a miss for me. loved the fit and style, which i'd say is pretty true to size, i just didn't love the color on me. i went for the orange one and the color was a bit too bright for my liking. cute top though! for reference i'm a usually small, i'm 5'4"" and a small fit perfectly.",4,29/06/2018

Nice knit button up,I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.,5,01/11/2018
Great shirt,"I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.",5,21/04/2018
"Like, don't love","I'm keeping this blouse anyway. i purchased the olive and it's such a great color. i live in a warm climate and really don't need long sleeves, but since the color is so great and pairs well with a lot, i will keep it.",4,31/05/2018
Perfect shirt,"I own this shirt in dark green,
navy, and white.
it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.
it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.
and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).
well done!",5,01/07/2018
Sizing is off,"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however, i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse, it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it.",3,30/04/2018
"Nice top, awful fabric","The top fits nice, but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.",2,25/08/2018
"Do love it, however:","Tried the xs on in store from an online return, loved the tailoring but the shoulder seams were a bit tight and i'm usually a s in most tops. ordered the s and while it was flowy like some mentioned, it was still tailored on top & flattering. also versatile - wore it with wide leg denim & wedges as well as cut off shorts & boots. my only complaint is as the others mentioned, the almost immediate pilling even before the wash. sad about it because i love it. will keep and give a little extra tlc.",4,24/01/2018
Perfect for petites,"I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store, and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite, 32dd, usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit, i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length, but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors, and although the front is polyester, the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting, shorter tops, so i",5,09/08/2018
Beautiful top,"Another beautiful retailer top.  i ordered a small (5.4, 112 lbs, broad shoulders, athletic build) and it looked really large when i pulled it out of the package.  it's a bit large, but i wouldn't want it tighter through the bust (34c).  the colors are vibrant and the print is really beautiful.  although it can be hand-washed, i will be taking this to the cleaners to preserve the color! i love retailer because their clothing is so often  unique.",4,05/05/2018
Great tunic,"I love this top. i got the blue, the colors are deep and just beautiful
i'm normally a large, so i feel this top runs large. i got the medium and it fits perfect 
it is long, i'm 5'6"" and it hits the bottom of my butt. 
you won't be disappointed, try this top",5,29/10/2018
Nice tunic,"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well.
the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !",5,04/03/2018
Inconsistent size between the two colors,"Like others are saying, the sleeve and bust are running small.  i found out that when i was trying the blue color one (butterfly).  however, before trying the blue one, i tried the neutral color one at my local store in the same size (s), it fit me perfectly, no issue with the sleeve and bust.  i don't understand why they're different.",4,14/08/2018
Beautiful design,"I purchased the tan ""ish"" gray colored one in xs. it looks a bit mauve in the pictures, but is still very beautiful.. i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front. the one drawback is that the arms are very snug, especially the upper arm and chest. i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up. just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small.",5,26/11/2018
"Nice design, but loose fit","The shirt design is very nice, but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.",3,26/05/2018
Lovely top!,"I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print, i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.",5,02/11/2018
Like wearing art!,This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!,5,23/11/2018
"Pretty, but too long on my short torso","This is a very pretty blouse and i like the mix of fabrics. i bought this in my usual size and it fit nicely except for the fact it is much too long. i have a short torso, and all this does it just cling and sit on my butt. perhaps this would work very nicely on someone that was athletic or tall and slender. sad to say, i had to return this because of the length.",4,02/03/2018
Love the design,Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.,3,07/09/2018
Not flatteuing,While these seem like interesting designs which i applaud!  the execution in the design of the fabric is not appealing.,3,04/06/2018
Love it so much i got both,"I loved the print on both, but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit, size down. for myself, m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long, covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design, so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.",5,23/09/2018
Nice tunic,"I like this tunic. it is quite long and print in blue looks good with the butterflies. it feels very hot though! maybe better for winter. the sleeves are linen, i usually don't like linen much, it feels scratchy. this top works better in colder weather due to the sleeves and length of top. more like a tunic. i recommend it but am sending it back because i need something for summer.",4,18/06/2018
Gorgeous tunic,This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!,5,07/10/2018
Beautiful color and style,I really love the color of this item. it is very generous in cut. i would suggest sizing down as i like my clothes more fitted. i received many compliments among my colleagues who wearing.,4,03/04/2018
Just okay,I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.,2,22/04/2018
Pretty tank,"I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute, comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying, it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!",5,29/08/2018
Original top - runs large,"In that i'm on the busty-side, i thought, ""surely an xl will not be too large."" ah contraire. wanted it in crimson anyway, so will try it in a large. the fabric in the white is nice in that it is substantial enough not to see-through. will look most interesting under a sweater or jacket.",4,17/05/2018
Love it!,"Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large, so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized, but i love that look, and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b, 126 lbs, 5'10""",5,05/06/2018
Exactly as i'd hoped for.,"I love the details of this top: the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering, especially if you have a tummy. the arm holes aren't gaping like so many tops, so you don't even need a cami underneath to hide your bra. it is a bit on the larger side. i often wear a large, but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small.",5,17/09/2018
Love this!,"I absolutely love this top.....the color, style, fit..everything! i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium. i have had so many compliments wearing this top. it is very feminine, flows nicely, hangs well. love the color. can't recommend this enough!",5,12/07/2018
Perfectly cut!,This is a great summer top! love the way it drapes and the quality of the material. bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out. my only complaint is that it doesn't come in way more colors!,5,13/08/2018
Sleeveless ruffled top,"I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank. i usually wear a large in retailer tops. this top fit a bit loose. there is a bit more space around the armholes. this only concerns me because i can't wear a bra or cami without it showing. just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller. i am 68, around 5/5"" and weight 144 lbs. love the young, modern tops that i find at retailer. i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit (btw, there is a",5,29/07/2018
Cute but gigantic,"Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material, so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.",3,07/10/2018
Boxy fit,This is a very cute designed shirt but it fits very boxy and runs large,3,31/03/2018
Practical femininity,Love this. bought the cream in store and the burgundy online. perfect alone or to wear under an retailer sweater.,5,03/11/2018
Boho vibe,Flowy boho tank. great details. good fabric. wear under a long cardigan or with a pair of denim cut offs and a necklace. oversized fit. i would size down one size.,5,02/04/2018
Pleated ruffle tank crimson,"This is an awesome tank top, comfortable, great fit, casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top. i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color. this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect.",5,01/10/2018
Too fussy and too big in the wrong places,"I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine, whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short, as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh",2,09/05/2018
Great versatile top,"I really like the style of this top, the open sleeves are subtle. i think it is even work appropriate in a business casual environment. it is slightly short waisted in my opinion and runs a little small, but my usual medium worked for me. i am a solid 8.",4,05/02/2018
Meh,"I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits, but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.

true to size.",3,10/10/2018
Not as expected,"Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway, i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.",2,21/10/2018
Cute top!,"I saw this in the store, it is definitely something i had passed over on line. it is so flattering on! i bought in ivory then immediately ordered the grey online!",5,13/11/2018
Love it!,"I seriously love this top, and at the sale price it's a steal! i ordered the ivory color and it's just as beautiful in person as in the product photos. i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit. i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse. it can be dressed up or down and is great for work (at least in my very casual office). the fit is perfect; i ordered my normal size medium and it's definitely true-to-size.",5,15/09/2018
Fabric looks inexpensive,"The arm slits are actually subtle, and don't gape open. the chiffon type pleats are lovely, but the cotton material they overlay appears cheap and isn't dressy enough for my work.",3,06/12/2018
Useful top,"I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous ""dress it up or dress it",5,29/06/2018
The sleeves.....,"I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....",2,26/02/2018
Statement sleeves leave me timeless and trendy,"So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasn't expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i",5,02/08/2018
True to picture,"Due to the prior review, this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.",4,16/03/2018
Black or grey?,This is a great shirt. the ruffles are strategically placed and hide any stomach flaws. i get that others are surprised by the arm slits but a couple of well placed stitches will make it very work appropriate or if you're worried about arm waggle. the color borders on black/navy,4,05/05/2018
Not for me,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.,2,05/07/2018
Not a keeper,"I have to agree with another reviewer - this blouse has an odd fit! the small petite (my usual size) was a good length and there was plenty of room in the body, however i found the shoulders to be quite small which made the neckline pull. since i definitely do not have broad shoulders this may be a particular problem for those that do. i also found the gathered seam above the bustline and across the upper back resulted in an unflattering maternity top effect. the blouse i was sent had one sleeve",3,25/03/2018
"Colorful, pretty shirt","Casual, pretty. runs a little large, especially through the waist, but a great comfortable shirt.",4,17/04/2018
Worn once...already received compliments,"Great light-weight blouse for mild fall days. fabric is thin so not too warm, which is great for southern california fall. great color palate.",5,05/05/2018
Awkward fit - was not wowed,"I love natural colors and nature themes but this top was a disappointment. i ordered both the small and the xs because retailer can run very large. the small was too big and the xs did not hang correctly, the arms hit at a weird spot and the neckline wouldn't sit right. overall the fit was boxy and unflattering. the fabric is pretty but the style is well....boring. there was just no wow factor for me. i think the fabric deserved a much better design. imho i think this top might be better suited fo",3,16/06/2018
Sweet and comfy,"I like this comfy top. i bought it to wear with a cute pair of gold charlie cropped pants i bought from retailer last fall. the only thing i don't like is the odd length of the sleeves. they are somewhere between elbow and 3/4. i am a true xxsp in most tops, but the sleeves end right at my elbow making it difficult to wear them unrolled. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. a larger size would have been too wide and roomy. overall, i am happy with my purchase.",4,17/03/2018
Pretty blouse; comfortable; buy one size smaller,"This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops, but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere, but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area, so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton, so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath, and i can't see m",5,03/05/2018
Goes with anything,This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,5,21/03/2018
Beautiful flowy top,"This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose, but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.",5,12/06/2018
Great netural top.,"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.
i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.
a great staple for your closet.",5,03/05/2018
"Nice print, sloppy design","This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know, it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my",2,24/06/2018
Enormous....,"I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.",2,25/03/2018
Stunning,"I'm in love with this top! looks just like it does in the photos, except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant. it's definitely boxy, so you may not like it if boxy isn't your thing, but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape. i usually wear a small in tops and the xs/s fits great. it's also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus (although i haven't washed it yet). unique, chic, and effortless...order before it's gone!",5,07/02/2018
Darling but size down,I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.,3,06/02/2018
Fantastic in both colors!,"I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i",5,30/08/2018
Polo shirt with twist,"I'm 5'2, 105lbs and bought xsp. seems a bit too short for my taste especially since this is a popover, but not bad enough to return. everywhere else fits tts. nothing stunning about it, but is unique enough to add to my everyday casual. it would be better if there are more colors to choose from.",4,16/10/2018
Quintessential white top,This feels so nice and light and summery. nothing like a crisp white top for the season.,4,10/06/2018

New staple,"I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2"") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.",5,01/02/2018
Perfect,"I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual, 2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown, so it is not constricting at all.",5,02/09/2018
"True to size, versatile","My measurements: i'm a 36b so i got the medium. it fits perfectly. i originally purchased this in the gray to wear during the day in winter months, but i loved it so much that i came back and purchased the black for evenings with skinny jeans and heels. it's so soft and pretty, can be dressed up or down, and now i'm thinking about getting the wine color too! i *love* it. i washed it in cold/gentle and let it air dry and it held up fine. i wouldn't push it though. treat it delicately. it's a smar",5,24/05/2018

Love this!!!,Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!,5,13/07/2018

Beautiful embellishment and color,"The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean, otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.",3,07/08/2018

Love this tank!,"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",5,08/08/2018
Very flattering!,"I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though, i thought it flattering enough to keep.",5,13/11/2018
Almost great,"I'm desperate for cute patterned shells to either layer or wear alone. i wanted this cute print to work - and it can, but it's just not great. the material is almost spandex-y, which is a bit weird. the only place it ran a bit small on me is the length of the straps, making the neck and the arms higher than i like. if i go up a size, it might be too much fabric and pleated swing around the waist. so close!",4,16/07/2018
Love!,"I'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before.  it is a flattering fit on me in size large.  i just love the colors in the print!  also, the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut.  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch.  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt, denim capris or with shorts.  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf.  this is just so pretty!",5,29/01/2018
Great for summer,I ordered the blue top. it's great for the hot summer we're having in the southeast this year.,4,13/05/2018
"Fun cut, cute colors","I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.",5,18/11/2018
Too large at bottom,"This is such a cute top with so much potential, soft fabric, vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top, regrettably, has to go back.
i love swing tops but retailer, could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??",3,27/09/2018
Beautiful & feminine,Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!,5,01/06/2018
Not for big-busted ladies,"I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big, and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately, it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all, it will look like a maternity top on you.",3,01/07/2018
Lovely print...,"I was on the fence about this toposition because, as others have stated, it is quite billowy at the bottom. just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen v-neck cardi and it completely changed my mind!! wow! now i am not saying that this isn't beautiful on its own, because.it truly is!! i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe. i did not order a petite even though i am 5'3"", and for that in am glad! i ordered regular size xs (108 lbs/36b)",5,13/09/2018
Disappointed!,"The tank looks nothing like the one pictured, mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also, i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.",1,08/02/2018
Not what i expected,I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.,2,07/03/2018
Totally cute top,I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high. as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and i'm glad i did. i'm usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception. i'm tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because it's cut on the bias. it is a little low but i've been wearing it for parties. it might be too low for work depending on the setting. i don't usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty,5,23/08/2018
Beautiful blouse!,The green color is beautiful. i love the cut and material - it feels luxurious. definitely needs ironing before wear but is a must have,5,04/08/2018
Stunning color,"This top is lightweight and flows nice. i usually take a medium or large. i ordered a medium and it is slightly large. so if you are between sizes, i would go down. i will keep the medium because it isn't the type of blouse that should hug your body. the green is stunning.",5,23/03/2018
"Very pretty, very easy","This top is a very comfortable, very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front, which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!",4,21/07/2018
Not a wow,"I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape
very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.",1,29/01/2018
Nice fit,"I'm not usually a fan of ruffles, but this blouse has a very smooth and flowing, front. it's flattering and feminine without looking frilly. easy to dress up or down.",4,04/03/2018
This surprised me,"I don't ever do ruffles - i'm a 36ddd - but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy. the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear. it will be easy to dress up with a necklace, blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on it's on with jeans for a casual look. if there had been the mint color in my size, i would have gotten it too!",5,02/03/2018
Lovely!,"This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual, t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely, and it's very feminine. i got the light blue color, and can't wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!",5,02/04/2018
Beautiful blouse,"I purchased the green in xs and it fits perfect. it's very flattering. also, i purchased the blue in xxsp (only size available), but it was too short.",5,21/08/2018
Great find!,I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.,5,01/03/2018
Beautiful color and flattering design,"Beautiful color and flattering design!
cons: tends to get wrinkled and you have to be careful about ironing. i ended up buying the shirt twice because i burned a hole in it while trying to use a poor quality hotel iron. i didn't even have a chance to wear it, but i loved the shirt so much that i bought it again since it was a good sale price.",4,09/05/2018
Wonderful spring top,I was taking my time with this purchase i needed a top for a pair of ombrã© silk pants that i had tailored to fit. but everytime i put these pants on i couldn't find any top to come close to match..especially since the pants are for a more sophisticated look. well this top fits that perfectly and i'm excited to pair them for a nice dinner out. plus i was equally excited when i could pair the top with my jeans and sandals.,4,11/08/2018
Meh...,"This shirt was on sale, and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap!",2,23/03/2018
Pretty blouse,Very cute but a little short. currently pregnant so i'm hoping it will hang better in a few months,4,22/07/2018
Fun andfestive,Fancy and fun. i love the green and the texture. shiny outside and soft inside. flattering fit and a little whimsical and dressy or casual.,4,01/10/2018
Lovely in sky blue,"I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a t-shirt! the sky blue color is spectacular. the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering! i am tall at 5'8"" and it was plenty long enough. i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect. it is cut to follow the lines of the body. i can't wait until the spring so i can wear it! it would be great if it was available in more colors.",5,10/03/2018
Like a mullet,"I love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it. i would have realized the front and back are different materials, which i am not a fan of. i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back. it's like a mullet, business in the front and party in the back. it's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though, so into rotation it goes.",3,17/11/2018
Not what it appears,"I did not have the same experience as the reviewers. this shirt is not what i thought. the front is low cut and i would have to wear something under it. i could not wear this to work, and i would not wear it in public. the fabric isn't bad, but feels flimsy.the fit is tight. i wear a small, or xs in most shirts, and this was ordered in a small and it was tight. i did like the green though, and the color in person is nicer than what is pictured.",3,12/07/2018
Gorgeous top!,"I fell in love with this top the minute i saw it, best of all, i was not disappointed when i tried it on. the fabric is soft and looks classy, the color is a rich and deep emerald green and the quality is really nice. you can dress it up or down depending on the occasion, this top will look gorgeous with a nice pair of jeans or a dressy skirt. true to size :)",5,11/08/2018
So cute!,I just love this blouse! it fits well and is really feminine and pretty. i paired it with a skirt and received lots of compliments!,5,25/09/2018
Comfy but sexy,"Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty.",5,28/05/2018
Gorgeous top,This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.,5,25/06/2018
Classy,Bought this blouse in white. fits great. can be worn with many things. dressed up or down.,5,20/04/2018
Cute tee with a bit extra!,I bought this top in the black color and it's great! the lace sleeves are so soft- not itchy at all and it is very flattering.,5,22/08/2018
Not for large busts,"This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust, with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice, the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me, but it may lay better on a different body type.",3,29/03/2018
"Has some good things going for it but didn't ""wow""","I tried the green one on in the store, as my store only had the green. the lace was sort of fuzzy-looking and i couldn't tell if the items were shop-worn or if the lace was supposed to look like that. since they all looked that way, i decided it was the look of the original fabric and i tried it on. i do like the combination of the lace sleeves and v-neck. a bit dressy but casual also. although i sometimes appreciate a little forgiveness in the tummy area, in this case the design was too loose a",4,04/09/2018
Exceeded expectations,"I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs.
i was a little worried the small might be too long &/or tentlike (i probably would have ordered a petite small had it been available), but it fits great!!!
i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!",5,21/11/2018
Beautiful black top,"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have",5,01/07/2018
Light and breezy,"This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price.",3,06/10/2018
Nice basic,"I like the shirtsleeves for south florida and the material. the design is great too. hits high up on my waist which i like. i ordered the black, but had to send it back as the medium was too big. i usually take a medium, but the small fits perfect. like white a lot and ordered the gold too.",4,16/04/2018
Love it!,"I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn't too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much!",5,11/06/2018
Cute turtleneck,"I love the design of this top - short and swingy, with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes, definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes, so you can kind of see your bra from the side.",5,29/11/2018
"Love the top, but the armholes!","I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however, not only are the armholes are too large, the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes, it becomes a crop top, not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work, but alas, it went back.",2,19/02/2018
Nice...but not true white,"Love this, but it is not a true white. it's slightly ivory, winter white. please be accurate with color descriptions! it's extremely frustrating when online retailers don't describe colors accurately. it can be hard to see subtle color differences in photos (especially with the color white) due to lighting of the shot. we rely on descriptions when ordering online. it's not difficult to do, really it's not.

that said, i didn't have any armhole trouble as others did. they were sized just right,",4,30/03/2018
Just as shown,"Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks, skirts, culottes, jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4'', 130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.",5,16/05/2018
Beautiful top but large arm holes,"I loved everything about this shirt except the harm holes are oddly large. i tried on a medium and the arm holes were very large so i thought a small would fit better but it didn't, the fabric is beautiful and the diamond pattern looks amazing up close but i decided to return the top because the arm holes just stuck out so awkwardly.",3,23/07/2018
Wear this tank anywhere,"I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.",5,22/07/2018
Huuuuuuge armholes!!!!,"Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas, my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top, but the way it cuts, you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me, but wish it worked. it is really pretty.",3,07/04/2018
Loved the style but was too short on me,"I loved the pattern, color and mock turtleneck style of this top, but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5"", 32d, 110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work, but every time i raised my arms, you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also, and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s",3,03/10/2018
Who was the petite fit model for this?,"I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size), i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it, then decided that was crazy. disappoin",2,15/06/2018
This product runs too small.,"Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try.",3,02/11/2018
Love the top,"I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.",5,25/08/2018
Cute!,Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.,5,12/05/2018
Runs small!!,"I was sad that this was only online because i wanted to try on the xs and small to compare. i usually wear an xs in most antrho clothes, and i decided to get an xs because i was afraid the peplum part would be large. however, when i got it in the mail, the xs is too small! i tried to get it in a size up, but i couldn't find it. it's a cute shirt, but it runs small. even the length of the shirt is shorter than i would have liked. if they had the correct size, i would have gotten it, but this shir",4,27/08/2018
Perfect lightweight tee!,"I love, love this top! it's the perfect peplum tee! i would get more if this was offered in more color combos! the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and it's a perfect soft cotton. can't say enough about this one!",5,05/04/2018
Not if you're busty,"I am a 32dd, 5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.",2,18/10/2018
Not great for smaller chests,"The fabric is lovely, color was great, but unfortunately it ran a bit large. this might be a case of girls with boobs vs. girls without. i have a small chest so for me, this just didn't stay in place. i was worried about the arms squeezing me so i got a small rather than my usual xs. bad choice. the diamond in the middle pooches out rather than hugging your body (which was what i was hoping for). when i raise my arms the whole shirt ends up riding up. pretty awkward. there's also a lot of fabric",3,01/07/2018
Love this shirt,Great fir and very flattering. keep in mind that it's a little low cut. some bras may not be low enough or may show.,4,22/06/2018
Comfy and great for large breasts.,"This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase.",4,28/06/2018
Great top for old 70's chicks,"I usually wear a small or medium depending on the cut, but this one only worked in a large. with or without a bra, it was not too low and covers all the middle area flaws beautifully. bust size average and i have muscular (not sticks) arms and a fairly wide back. nice and drapey, pretty green color. great sale price.",4,17/09/2018
My favorite cut and style for me,"I loved the fabric, cut and style of these shirts, the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully. 
please make again 
maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic, a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker. 
sill i love this top",3,22/08/2018
Another deletta beauty,"I have literally dozens of deletta tops. just four things to know: very unique/attractive, run large/stretch out (size down), poor quality fabric, and usually low cut.",4,07/03/2018

Not impressed,"Cute design. runs big in neckline, falls off shoulder exposing bra straps. fabric is very thin. sloppy look on short petite frame. 5'1"" 142lbs 34-36 c/d. purchased a medium. haven't washed it yet, but the fabric doesn't look like it will hold up well. i have kept it to wear as a sleep shirt with thin gray sleep sweats.",3,21/05/2018
The perfect tee! elegant..,"I slightly balked at the cost, but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product, and it is made in the usa. in these times, that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck, front and back and the slightly lengthened sides, very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing"", which is one extra step... still, i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium, my usual ( size",5,10/06/2018
For the price...just ok,"Note: if you have a large chest, the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt, just not great for the price.",3,28/07/2018
Love this tee!,"This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back.",5,03/11/2018
Cute!,"Love this shirt. i have it in black.  i have a larger chest, but i don't feel like the seams hit me wrong.  this is super cute and swingy.  i however think the price is way too high for a think cotton tee.",4,30/06/2018
Simple t with a twist,I love this shirt! it's a nice simple long-sleeved tee with some nice details. i especially love the seaming on the front & back-- very flattering!,4,16/11/2018
Wonderful supima cotton top!,"This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!",5,28/04/2018
This shirt is a great everyday shirt!,"It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!",5,16/05/2018
Beautiful top,So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!,5,09/04/2018
Bummer!,"Ugh, i hate that this didn't work! the top shoulder/sleeve portion is so pretty and unique, but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling, the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is (the sides go way up on me). the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash. back it goes!",2,03/10/2018
Cute cut but a little thin,The cut of this top is cute. it's a great basic t with a little flare. it's pretty pricey given that the fabric is so thin.,4,21/02/2018
Gorgeous jewel tone color,"The other reviews stated this was a shapeless top, but i sized down and it is very flattering and cute! the green is a bright, gorgeous jewel tone. it has an overall flowy, bohemian look to it.......the bell sleeves add just the right touch of boho! overall, i am very pleased with this top... it will be a great transitional piece into fall!",4,25/09/2018
Absolutely gorgeous,"I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it",5,29/08/2018

Gorgeous top,"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top.

Nice fabric,"I really like this shirt. it runs somewhat big but i love the oversized effect as seen on the model. i normally wear a m in shirts and the s was spot on. the only quality issue is with the buttons..they are a bit flimsy when you unbutton them. other than that, this is a great shirt and the price with the promo is just right.",4,09/04/2018
Great summer top,"I don't know what it is about this top but i was so drawn to it when i saw it in the store. it's totally see through, that's the design and i think it's great. i wear a cami underneath but if you're more daring or you spend a lot of time by the beach, you can get away with a nude bra or bikini top. this definitely runs small. i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear xs/s but felt most comfortable in a medium. the body isn't tight or anything, it's just on the shorter side, especially if you have a longer t",4,17/11/2018
Runs very small,"This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately, it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3"" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it, but i'm sending it back.",2,28/07/2018
Totally see-through!,"I just got this in the mail and was so excited to try this cute top.....but it's completely see-through! unlike the photo shows, the lining is not included. quite a disappointment top is well made though no give in the fabric.",3,21/08/2018
Cute style,"This is a really cute style of t-sihrt. i totally disagree with the reviewers who thought this was too short in the torso and/or overwhelming. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds and this fits just fine. (i ordered a size small.) beautiful drape and (i thought) relatively slim cut. the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars across the board is that the fabric is a little too thin (not sheer or see-through, but not as substantial as i would expect for the price.",4,30/10/2018
The perfect summer tee!,"I love this top! its so comfortable and light weight! it drapes beautifully, with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom. so flattering! i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out!",5,18/11/2018
Little overwhelming on me,"I had high hopes for this cool top. i ordered it in xxs because no petites were available at the time, and i think the size is just right (i'm +/- 105 lbs, 34aa). i just suspect it looks better on people with broad shoulders, like the models'; mine are kind of narrow. plus, crew necks aren't the most flattering neckline on me. i would say it's fairly short, just barely covering my belt, so on taller people it may be cropped, and the waist is kind of fitted, as shown. i love that it's cotton, mad",4,02/08/2018
Ugly design,"So i bought this, even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all, 5""2. had to go back.",1,25/04/2018
The taupe is to die for,"I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!",5,01/08/2018
Give it a pass,"Pretty shirt on the hanger, but there's a goof in the design. when i tried it on my 3d self, there became this weird ruffle right beside/below the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo, now that i know it's there. the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept, but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and it's not flattering, and i'm just a 34 b.",2,17/02/2018
Costume material,"I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey, but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly, i will be returning this top.",2,12/03/2018
Cool for every figure,"This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!",5,13/02/2018
"Comfy, flattering and beautiful!","Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.",5,25/04/2018
"Good idea, poor execution","This tunic is a perfect length for leggings. the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing. and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering. however, when i wore it a second time, i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve. one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder. since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes, it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl",2,19/10/2018
"Love this top, with a slight modification","I saw this top in my local store and almost didn't try it on solely because i hate split-sleeve/cold-shoulder tops. but, the peplum style and pattern were so cute that i took it into the dressing room anyway. after trying on probably 6-8 items, i wound up buying this top and one other. i really like the fit, as i am high-waisted, and it defines my waist really well . the wide neck is also super flattering. and i love the pattern. i went ahead and purchased, despite the fact that i wasn't thrille",4,08/03/2018
Easy interesting top,"This top is really comfortable, and the details make it easy to add interest to an outfit. i was worried all the details together would be a bit overwhelming, but it works. i wish the design was on the back as well, but it's fine. the material is a nice light weight, but the pleats do fold up a little after washing, so ironing is required.",4,02/11/2018
Split sleeves -- you can't tell from pics online!,"Tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split, so any movement reveals most of your arm, shoulders. which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office (yes, i could wear a sweater or blazer with it, but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top.) why, retailer? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc., but the split sleeves make it a no-go.",3,09/05/2018
Elegant and creative,"This blouse is a great transitional piece. as other reviewers have noted, the sleeves are split and that's the only reason why it gets four stars instead of five. i wore it with a 3/4 sleeve black top underneath to eliminate this issue for the cooler months. overall design is good and the print is classy and creative. this will be a lovelyt go-to blouse to wear with denim. fits the budget too.",4,21/05/2018
Better in person,"This top is prettier in person than on the picture. the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap - it actually looks nice in person. it's very comfy and feminine, showing just the right amount of skin on the arms. the elastic on the waist also makes me look 3 lbs. lighter. it goes good with jeans or skirts.",5,25/09/2018
Gorgeous top!,Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.,5,21/02/2018
"Cute, flattering, and goes with everything","I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby, so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything, i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected, but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft, comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!",5,05/04/2018
Beautiful,Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!,5,28/09/2018
Print version is beautiful in size xl,"I ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. i love the mix of colors, especially for fall. i've always had great luck with the fit & wear of this brand. i'd love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer.",5,23/06/2018
Love it! want the blue color too.,"Fits well, comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.",5,09/02/2018
Cute top,"I ordered this in a s (for reference, i am 5'7"", 128-130 lb, 32dd, with a 27"" waist), and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest, but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs, but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model, but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric, which has a jus",5,17/07/2018
A nice twist on the traditional peplum,"A fun top!
i tried on both the medium and large (i'm between sizes, 5'4"", 34g) and preferred the large. the medium waist rode up a bit on my torso, so the large stayed down a bit. also, the medium pleats did not fall as nicely on my chest.",4,11/10/2018
Unflattering for pear shapes,"I wanted to love this top so badly. between the beautiful photos and the good reviews, i didn't think i could go wrong with it. unfortunately, it just didn't look great on. the bust area sagged on my smaller chest, and then the top flared way out from the waist down. it doesn't lay even remotely flat like the photos would have you believe. maybe this would look better on hourglass or slim types. the quality does appear to be good -- the material is weighty and soft.",3,12/11/2018
It's all good,I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.,5,26/11/2018
Versatile,"I bought the purple motif in size medium, my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer.",5,19/08/2018
So adorable!,"I ordered my usual size s in the purple print. this peplum top style, colors/pattern will go easily with pretty much anything.. shorts, pants, jeans & skirts. wear for casual or dress it up. for me the fit is tts. armholes provide good coverage & length is fine. the top has a bit of stretch & doesn't feel restrictive. the waist is banded & a little loose which is fine. don't like tight fitting waists on tops. i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer. the skirt",5,16/03/2018
"Super cute, comfy, flattering","Love this tank! the purple motif is gorgeous, and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge. at 5'4"" / 130# with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio, i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long. in this top i found the petite small too short, but the regular small was perfect. the waist hits right above my natural waist, the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo, and the armholes are the right length. beautiful flattering cu",5,01/10/2018
Very flattering,This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!,5,14/08/2018
Happened to like,"I happened to really like this top. it does show some back, but looked cute with high waisted jeans. i happened to like the raw hemline and found it quite comfortable and cute. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the size small fit well, though i could have gone with a medium for a much looser look.",4,06/09/2018
Super soft and sweet,"I loved the details on the top of the shirt but was especially excited by the length of the top - it comes just over the hips and gives a flattering fit, as well as the sweet little micro sleeves. the color is kind of worn looking but it is so soft. i will definitely wear this a lot. 
 
i bought a medium but probably could've gotten away with a small.",5,09/08/2018
Very nice casual top,"I love love this top. it is a very pretty casual top. it looks very nice on and is more like a tunic. perfect with jeans, very casual but the embroidery, ruffle sleeves, and buttons at the top add a nice touch. i have the red, i am considering buying this in blue as well, i have so many newly purchased blue tops!",4,27/05/2018
Casual & unique tee,"I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim",3,20/02/2018
Huge,"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.",1,02/09/2018
Pernette henley,"I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it's definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it's going back.",3,20/06/2018
Comfy,"At first i wasn't sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i'm not showing the world my torso.",4,16/02/2018
Poor quality,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,1,16/03/2018
The perfect striped t,"The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it!",5,28/11/2018
Pernette henley,"In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it's super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i'm happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t.",4,08/08/2018
So cute,This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.,5,13/08/2018
This is not red!,"I was looking for a shirt of this style. i thought it was very cute, but it is not ""red' as advertised. it is really a brick orange-y color, which is definitely not what i wanted. very disappointed. sent it right back.",3,30/06/2018
Sporty and chic,"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed",5,14/05/2018
"Great, great top","Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.",5,06/11/2018
Comfy,Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,5,15/11/2018
Comfortable,"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.",5,02/04/2018
A lovely piece to be worn and cherished,"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.",5,04/08/2018
"Super cute, but big","This top is so cute! love the stripes in the red print and the detailing of the buttons. however, it does run slightly big! i'm 5'8"", 145 and got the medium. it's so low in the front that i do have to wear a cami underneath. i see why they designed it a little larger since it comes up on the sides and it's supposed to be more of a relaxed fit. i typically love when shirts are long since i'm a little taller and this one hits perfectly in the front. it does dip down in the back and covers my bum (",4,24/01/2018
Comfort and style,"I love this tee, it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders, a good v-neck, and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.",5,24/08/2018
Summer time comfort,"I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made, super soft, and works well with jeans, capris, skirts, and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though, this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a",4,26/08/2018
Cute summer tee!,"I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.",5,29/05/2018
Waaay to big,"Ordered this in xs my normal size (5'5"" 110 lbs) and it was huge! did not particularly care for the style either nothing special.",3,01/08/2018
"Cute, casual top","I love the button details on this top. i was expecting the material to be thicker, but it's quite thin. it isn't sheer, but i will layer it for the winter months. overall the fit is true to size. i am 5'0, 110 lbs and the xxs fit me well. the arms were more snug than shown on the model and the shirt was loose without being too flowy or boxy.",4,10/05/2018
Comfy & versatile,"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",5,03/02/2018
Disappointed purchase,Material is too thin and quality is poor,1,26/06/2018
Shirt has slits!,"This is a cute shirt, but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason.",3,19/08/2018
Loooooooow cut,"This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which, for me, defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd), so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.",3,31/08/2018
Runs large for brand,"I am 5 '4"", 124lbs, and 36 c - usually take a small or sometimes a medium in t.la tops. this top seems to run particularly large as i ended up with an xs.",4,26/01/2018
"More colors, please!","Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",5,01/11/2018
T.la's cutest tee. ever!,"Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.",5,26/01/2018
"Cute design, poor quality","This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",1,13/08/2018
It's in the details,"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.
fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of",5,11/07/2018
Priced too high,I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.,3,27/04/2018
Quality doesn't match the price,"This is a cute top, but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors, pattern and soft material used. however, the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58.",3,13/04/2018
"Pretty and comfrotable, get on sale","I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy), but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee, but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said, i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.",3,12/02/2018
I'm going to wear it a lot,I did size up on this one. it came in and it was too snug for a loose shirt. i sized up and i love it now. i went to the store and bought it in white and black. i sized up in the white but not the black. you may want to try them on before purchasing them. i want more.,4,18/11/2018
Cute tshirt,I really liked this tshirt but unfortunately the v-neck is just too low for my taste. it fits really loose and even buying the xxs i just felt it would stretch out and be even bigger. really cute style just not sure it's worth the price. great colors though.,3,14/02/2018
Great t-shirt,"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium.",5,16/06/2018
Beautiful tee,I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!,5,13/11/2018
Awesome every day tee,"I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)",5,20/09/2018
Comfy yet stylish,"I saw this tee and was unsure about the print, but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did, as it has become a weekend staple.",4,02/06/2018
Pretty top,Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.,5,13/10/2018

I feel so betrayed...,"I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.",2,30/09/2018
V-neck tee,"Fit is okay, the style of the shirt and the purple flowers are beautiful!",4,09/09/2018

V neck,Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t,5,09/07/2018
Not my thing,"Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered,' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft, true fit, and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'",3,14/02/2018

Casual striped v-neck t-shirt,"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt.

Great shirt,I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.,5,30/09/2018
Perfection!,"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.",5,07/12/2018

Great basic t,"This top is true to size, although i am a little nervous about washing it... hopefully it won't shrink. it is super think so great for hot days but because it's so thin, i'll be careful. i have white and am def. going to get more colors. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i think medium might cut to low in the v, but haven't tried it yet, let's just say if it shrinks after washing i will get a medium...",4,02/03/2018
Cute tee shirt,"Very soft and lovely t-shirt. beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck. i am 140 lbs and 5' 4"" and got a large.",5,28/11/2018
Great t,"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".
it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well.",1,13/09/2018
Cute top,"I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6"" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well.",5,10/11/2018
Great shirt!,"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!",5,08/03/2018
Purple floral tee,I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.,5,27/01/2018
Great deal!,Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!,5,24/03/2018
Nice tee!,"I usually wear a small or a medium in tee shirts, and i had to get a medium so that it fit comfortable throughout the shoulder area.",4,26/11/2018
"Cute, great color, runs a little big","I got this in light green and it's a gorgeous color. first tried a small, but it was a little too wide and long. exchanged for xs, looks great. now i just hope it doesn't shrink too much!",4,05/04/2018
What's up with the tag??,"I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.",2,15/07/2018
Cute but where is the skirt???,I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??,5,04/04/2018
Cute tee,"I bought one of these tees and i washed it a few times and luckily no holes yet like other reviews have stated. i just got a 2nd tee as they are quite comfy. i bought these both in-store but the petite size might have been better for my frame. i wish retailer would look into having petite sizes available in store and not just online. sometimes i do get lucky on finding petite sizes in-store, but it's usually from a return.",4,31/03/2018
"Too thin, too sheer","I have been looking for a nice white top to go with many of my skirts for summer, and this is not it. like others, it's just so thin and sheer. i live in the south. i don't need my bra showing and i was wearing a nude bra when i tried this on and you can see everything. this is fine to layer in cooler temps, but now in our horrible summers where that's the last thing i wish to do.

- the only plus i can tell you is it's tts and the fabric is so comfortable and feels great on the skin. however,",3,11/06/2018
My new favorite tee,"When i walked into the store, this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight, not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans, skirts or shorts.",5,08/12/2018
Love the stripes,"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.",5,27/09/2018
"Cute tee, very soft","I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!",5,08/10/2018
Perfect....for two wears,"Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.",1,22/03/2018
Great shirt,The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.,5,31/01/2018
Staple with flair,Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!,5,07/11/2018
Lots of compliments,"I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. 

i'm a size 2 and bought a small.",5,08/04/2018
Cute and comfortable tee!,Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!,5,16/05/2018
"Cute idea, poor execution","I love the cold shoulder trend, and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue, which is really more like a very light mint green. however, i think the material is pretty thin (though soft), and the keyhole sleeve area, right by the twist, is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small, but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds, 32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price, thou",3,01/06/2018
What's with the pocket?,"I love this shirt but have 1 issue- that darn pocket. it's so awkward. it even looks awkward on the model. then, i bought another t-shirt by the same company from elsewhere and guess what? same awkward weird floppy pocket. it's so odd, i can't even explain it.",4,01/07/2018
Great t!!!,I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.,5,04/12/2018
Thin and blah,"This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w",1,06/05/2018
Cute tee,"Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs.",4,21/02/2018
My go-to tshirt!,"I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small.",5,23/04/2018
Best tee ever!,"I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.",5,07/06/2018
Tla t shirt,This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!,5,21/04/2018
White is see-through,"This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white, which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color, but i returned it since it was nothing special.",3,03/07/2018
T-shirt love,T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.,5,06/03/2018
Well-made basic,I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'4 and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.,5,08/10/2018
Easy,"Easy, breezy comfortable light weight tee",5,31/03/2018
Love this tee!,"I picked up this tee in store, where they had a pattern that isn't pictured here (purple floral on a grey background). this is a loose fitting tee, and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering- however, this one fits great and is flattering. the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable. this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe! considering ordering in other colors.

for reference, i'm 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 measurements, 34ddd",5,26/05/2018
So soft!,"A perfect basic tee!
loved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale.",5,16/06/2018
Summer's must have tee!,"I love these t.la tees, and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt.",5,13/11/2018
Great basic tee,I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.,5,19/06/2018
Tee,"I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white, but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.",3,28/05/2018
Great casual tshirt!,"I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!",5,12/07/2018
Much bigger than last year's version,"I ordered these tees in the navy and pink thinking that it would be a slam dunk given i already bought 3 of the same tees last year. not so. this year's version is much bigger - almost 2 inches wider and about 2 inches longer. there was even a 2 inch difference between the pink and navy version so i have to assume that sizing may vary among different colors. too bad for me - but i did read a review that thought the tees were better this year. i guess we are all different. at 5'7"", 115lbs i prefe",3,06/12/2018
Too short,I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!,2,11/03/2018
Adorable top!,"I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online, and decided to order it. the fabric is soft, but strong, and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.",5,31/08/2018
One of my favorite/go-to tops!,"I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.",5,23/04/2018
Super comfy,I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!,5,29/05/2018
"Love the design & color, not the fabric & sizing.","I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however, the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5"", 125#, 34c), but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally, the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l",3,13/09/2018
Very soft fabric but size down,I seldom take anything but a size m in retailer tops. this m top fits ok but it is a bit sloppy overall. one reviewer says it is 'body skimming' but not on me. i am a true m yet a m seems to fit in the shoulders but overall just too big. i love the fabric and print however i will exchange for a size s if it is available. it does hide the tummy area but ends up looking like a pajama top on me.,4,08/06/2018
Beautiful t-shirt!,"Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen), but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall, and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!",5,11/10/2018
I love this t shirt,"This shirt has beautiful colors in it. it goes with burgundy, grey, black, brown, blues, and denim. it's a generous cut, and quite lightweight for fall layering.",5,06/09/2018
The best tee,"T.la makes the best tees. soft feel, sophisticated color layering, and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile, too. other tees fade, stretch out, shrink. not t.la. a gem.",5,04/02/2018
My favorite tee,"This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...

i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr",5,05/12/2018
Love this shirt,"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!",5,19/02/2018
Love this shirt,"I do love this shirt as i am a yogi and love to wear things like this. it was a little boxy and big, but don't care because the style of it is so cute.",4,03/12/2018
Love it =)),Love the cute print and texture of fabric. perfect casual t-shirt.,4,03/06/2018
Adorable print for yogis,"I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!",5,17/04/2018
Super cute print,This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.,5,22/04/2018
Strike a pose,"The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms",5,28/09/2018
Cute tee,I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.,5,17/02/2018
Basic black t,"I got this in black and it's a great basic t-shirt- the v-neck is just right in depth, and the material is very soft and lightweight. the fit is good. the back is long, which can be good or not-so-good depending on how you want to wear it. i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well.",5,21/10/2018
Fine t shirt,I ordered this online. it's fine. i am usually a small in tops and it fits true to the size. good material. no complaints. looks good layered.,4,20/11/2018
Cute top,"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5.",5,07/10/2018
Cute pattern but feels cheap,Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price,3,12/11/2018
Great tee,"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!",5,10/09/2018
Perfect top!,"This is really my favorite top! i wear it all the time, like every day. it's so soft, a beautiful rich color (blue), has nice detailing, and so flattering on a hot momma like me who still has a little tummy from my three lovely children. snuck it in to my dressy office on a friday as well - with a conservative skirt and high heels. only downside is the lack of other nice colors. the stripe isn't cutting it. got my regular xs and it fits perfectly.",5,16/02/2018
Costs too much for low quality,"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric, wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it.",3,26/05/2018
Off,"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.",1,03/03/2018
Another sheer shirt,"The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices, i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it, the cotton just doesn't lay right.",3,18/09/2018
Great top!,I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.,5,29/01/2018
Cute and comfy style,"I was hoping not to like this tee so that i can be $48 richer (lol). it's very cute. i would say runs true, but more on the smaller side. i usually wear xs and it's a good cut for me. it's not boxy at all. i love the strap detail on this tee. i hope the quality will hold up. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs (2/4).",4,10/05/2018
"Not too sheer, but it is too long","I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top, but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck, but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit.",3,10/11/2018
Love this shirt!,"I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.",5,01/04/2018
Classic tee with flirty details,"This shirt is incredibly soft! i was drawn to the style based on the feel of the material and the cute tie up detailing in the back. definitely size down. the sleeves were a little snug, but sizing down will help with the length and the bust. my only problem with this shirt is that if you bend over, anyone can see down your top. so be aware! otherwise, the top is great and perfect for summer.",4,27/02/2018
Cute enough,"As far as t-shirts go, this one is fun, i love the lace up detail in the back. the xs regular fit nicely (115 lbs, 30dd), the shirt flares out (swing), so it can be a little much on the smaller gals, but it was ok enough on me that the stylist decided to try it on too. the orange color was pretty, but i decided to pass as i have a lot of orange tops... and that is the color that was most flattering on my skin. amterial is on the thinner side and a little tiny sheer, must be the trend...",4,27/04/2018
Doesn't fit well sized down,"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy, but as it runs large, sizing down means the sides come up really high, as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed, and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small.",3,11/04/2018
Very poor quality,"I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev",2,07/10/2018
Perfect tee but beware of blue!!,"I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!",5,02/11/2018
Cute spin on a basic tee,"It's thin, very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!
it's a stink top, i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.
aside from being a swing top, it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.
i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too, love it!",5,26/01/2018
Stylish and comfortable,I bought this top in every color. the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely - not too big. love!,5,04/09/2018
Short and wide,"I ordered this in the blue, it's a beautiful shade of blue. love the lace up detail in the back, but the size small was just short and very wide. i understand it is a swing top, but this was not flattering on me. i'm short waisted, 34-d, 5'3, 125 lbs.  i'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person.",3,23/07/2018
Very sheer,"Super flattering, a great length for me (5'9"") but very sheer.",4,04/12/2018
Second time's a charm,"While shopping with my daughters, i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white, but then retailer had a sale weekend, so i ordered the blue with a discount, so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice.",4,08/12/2018
Lovely simple staple,"I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun, swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!",5,14/08/2018
"Cute, breezy, comfy","Great summer shirt, loose and casual. it's pretty flowy and not form-fitted at all. i almost always wear a petite xs in retailer, and that is what i got (i'm 5'4 and 125 pounds). fits great- loose and swingy, but is big (i like this). retailer, please get/restock petites for the pink color!",4,18/10/2018
Great top!,Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.,5,08/10/2018
Perfect top,"I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer.",5,26/05/2018
Perfect flowy top,I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.,5,19/08/2018
Cute !!,Super cute t-shirt keep in mind to is fairly long,4,01/09/2018
Shrunk to toddler size,"I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.",2,06/06/2018
Great top,"Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!",5,04/06/2018
Cute t shirt,"Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture.",5,29/03/2018
Terrible!,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend,1,02/04/2018
Poor fit,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.,2,29/06/2018
Felt too maternity,"I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty, even so, not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...",2,23/02/2018
Cute!,"This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in",5,19/10/2018
Great material,"Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.",5,25/04/2018
Not worth the money!,"I brought this shirt for a vacation, it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear, however, after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money.",2,16/05/2018
Too boxy,"I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.",2,02/03/2018
Tie back tunic,"I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.",1,01/09/2018
Complimentary color,"After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!",5,12/02/2018
Pretty blue,"That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute, but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows, and the string is at least 3 feet too long. 
not bad, i wear it with white gauze pants, looks nice. good with leggings too.",3,18/06/2018
Fit off,"I got a medium as i usually wear that in everything. i am a 36d and this pulled a bit across my chest and back. it is a cute idea, but the fit is off for my body. i am 5'6 and hits me shorter than shown on the model, so hits at an odd length. i may try to order a large and see if it is better on me, because i am so hopeful for this to look cute on me! the teal blue color is beautiful, the pink is more a blush and washed me out, the grey is just grey. i bought three thinking this would be my go t",3,20/04/2018
Disappointing,"I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful, drab actual color.",3,03/08/2018
Too short,"I love the look and feel of the material, but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly, it's going back to the store.",2,04/02/2018
Cropped,"I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :(",2,25/03/2018
"Nice tee, but i was not aware how cropped it is","The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too.",5,21/07/2018
Quality fabric,"Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with, however the top was way, say too big so i'll be sending it back.",5,03/12/2018
Very pretty and different,I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.,5,08/03/2018
Nice t-shirt!!,"This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available.",5,17/05/2018
Going to be a summer staple!,"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.",5,31/07/2018
Love this tee,"I love flowers! i love flowers on my basic tees even better! simple,comfy,but different from your every day plain old tee!",5,12/04/2018
Love the color,Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!,5,25/04/2018
Adorable but see through,"The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size, as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price, but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute, casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the",3,10/04/2018
Love this shirt in gray,I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.,5,25/02/2018
Ego booster,"Cute shirt but it is very hard to wrap my head around being an xxs. sizing is ridiculous. and now that i have an xs that is too big, the xxs are sold out. typical.",3,02/02/2018
Comfortable t-shirt,"This is casual and comfortable.
along with soft touch of its textile, i also like the pastel color of flower prints. 
especially, i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).
it also fits well with my body and makes look cool. 

it is perfect for everyday use.",5,26/03/2018
Sunshine on a t-shirt!,"This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif. when i saw this one, though, i simply had to have it! it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet. i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out, but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size. it is most definitely a better fit/length for me. i don't usually like to pay so much for a t-shirt, but i will splurge for something like this t",5,11/10/2018
Watercolor look,"Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6"" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium.",5,22/06/2018
Love this,Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath,5,04/12/2018
A+ tee,I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,5,01/10/2018
Why is this cute but simple shirt so expensive,"It's a t-shirt. a very cute print, nice cut, very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore, why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it, but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.

for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer, and the medium fit well.",3,23/09/2018
Beautiful blouse,"Love this shirt! i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine. it is true to size, perfect neckline- not too low or high and very flattering. see through enough to require a cami, but worth it. very soft fabric and really comfy.",5,26/06/2018
This tee makes me happy!,"I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5'1"" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy.",5,27/03/2018
Cute tee,"This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!",5,19/09/2018
Not as advertised!,"I like the look of this tee and the fit is fine but it's described as a ""cotton-rayon jersey"" and in fact it's 50% polyester. i would not have ordered if i had known and now have to take it back.",3,03/03/2018
Super soft t-shirt,"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length.",5,04/12/2018
Cute print,I ordered the yellow. i love this shirt it such a happy print. can match a lot of things.,5,12/02/2018
Vintage beauty,"I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as",5,21/02/2018
Love this t-shirt,Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!,5,20/11/2018
Fits nicely but fabric a bit thin,"I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing, the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash, too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.",3,04/04/2018
Pretty tee,Nice print and comfortable shirt.,5,23/08/2018
Nice weight,"Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.",5,01/04/2018
"Cute, cute!!","Literally the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because of my history with this brand (holes developing after minimal wear). i will do my usual wash but don't dry and hope it holds up!

material: super soft and comfortable, almost slubby. i haven't seen the yellow in person, the purple/grey is lovely. 

fit: moderate scoop neck as pictured (almost oval) that's a nice touch as it's not too low or high at the neck. not overly fitted over the chest or stomach - without being oversized - j",4,23/07/2018
Love it!,"I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s",5,19/06/2018
The perfect tee!,"Love the fit, feel and colors of this tee. looks great with white jeans, blue jeans and is so springy. longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me. may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit.",5,14/04/2018
Cute pattern,"I love t-shirts by t la, but unfortunately this particular one was different. the sizing was off. it ran small, although i ordered my usual size medium for this brand. i think the shirt is cute though;)",4,30/07/2018
Cute shirt,7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.,5,22/07/2018
Super soft,Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.,5,29/10/2018
Beautiful top,"I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.
i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect.",5,08/08/2018
So soft!,"This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!",5,01/02/2018
Nice summer weight t,"Pros: versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans. flattering cut. nice color palette. made in the usa. reasons for not giving 5's for overall rating and quality... shirt is a bit short overall (i'm 5'4). fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly, cotton, and rayon. will have to be careful with washing. better if you can purchase on sale. regular price was steep for a t-shirt.",4,02/07/2018
Love!!!!,"I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!",5,14/04/2018
Spring time tee,"I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy.",5,06/09/2018
Great tee,"Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!",5,23/01/2018
Cute tee - don't love the material,"This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees, size down. xs works good for me.",3,18/05/2018
Fabric is pretty thin,"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",2,12/04/2018
Theres just something about this shirt!,I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.,5,08/11/2018
Poor quality,"I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.",1,05/06/2018
Awesome!,"I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!",5,04/08/2018
Love it buy it!,Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...,5,05/07/2018
Yummy t,I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.,5,17/05/2018
Perfect oversize t,"It's the perfect long, loose t-shirt. flattering without being fitted. love it!",5,18/08/2018
Overpriced and see-through,"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately.",2,22/01/2018
Large loose thin flutter tee,"This tee is cute and unusual and i am sure i will wear it pretty often. i do wish i had ordered a size smaller than my normal large, but i am waiting for it to shrink in the wash a bit. the material is thin and it certainly doesn't feel like it is worth the price tag. i got it on sale and still think it is only worth about 20$.",4,16/07/2018
